	abstract = {Hymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, ants, and bees) are one of four mega-diverse insect orders, comprising more than 153,000 described and possibly up to one million undescribed extant species [1, 2]. As parasitoids, predators, and pollinators, Hymenoptera play a fundamental role in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and are of substantial economic importance [1, 3]. To understand the diversification and key evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera, most notably from phytophagy to parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to eusocial life, we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all major lineages of Hymenoptera by analyzing 3,256 protein-coding genes in 173 insect species. Our analyses suggest that extant Hymenoptera started to diversify around 281 million years ago (mya). The primarily ectophytophagous sawflies are found to be monophyletic. The species-rich lineages of parasitoid wasps constitute a monophyletic group as well. The little-known, species-poor Trigonaloidea are identified as the sister group of the stinging wasps (Aculeata). Finally, we located the evolutionary root of bees within the apoid wasp family “ Crabronidae.” Our results reveal that the extant sawfly diversity is largely the result of a previously unrecognized major radiation of phytophagous Hymenoptera that did not lead to wood-dwelling and parasitoidism. They also confirm that all primarily parasitoid wasps are descendants of a single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that lived around 247 mya. Our findings provide the basis for a natural classification of Hymenoptera and allow for future comparative analyses of Hymenoptera, including their genomes, morphology, venoms, and parasitoid and eusocial life styles.},

	abstract = {The stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) are an extremely diverse lineage of hymenopteran insects, encompassing over 70,000 described species and a diversity of life history traits, including ectoparasitism, cleptoparasitism, predation, pollen feeding (bees [Anthophila] and Masarinae), and eusociality (social vespid wasps, ants, and some bees) [1]. The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are the ants, which are ecologically dominant inmost terrestrial ecosystems [2], and the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3]. Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4-11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5-7]. We used ultra-conserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7, 12] to resolve relationships among stinging-wasp families, gathering sequence data from {\textgreater}800 UCE loci and 187 samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference.},

	abstract = {The frequency and the geographical extent of symbiotic associations between ants and fungi of the order Chaetothyriales have been highlighted only recently. Using a phylogenetic approach based on seven molecular markers, we showed that ant-associated Chaetothyriales are scattered through the phylogeny of this order. There was no clustering according to geographical origin or to the taxonomy of the ant host. However, strains tended to be clustered according to the type of association with ants: strains from ant-made carton and strains from plant cavities occupied by ants ('domatia') rarely clustered together. Defining molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) with an internal transcribed spacer sequence similarity cut-off of 99\% revealed that a single MOTU could be composed of strains collected from various ant species and from several continents. Some ant-associated MOTUs also contained strains isolated from habitats other than ant-associated structures. Altogether, our results suggest that the degree of specialization of the interactions between ants and their fungal partners is highly variable. A better knowledge of the ecology of these interactions and a more comprehensive sampling of the fungal order are needed to elucidate the evolutionary history of mutualistic symbioses between ants and Chaetothyriales.},

They are ecologically important, however, as occasional outbreaks of the homotomid Mycopsylla fici may cause complete defoliation of its host plant, the Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla). Mycopsylla proxima, the only other species reported from Australia, feeds on F.rubiginosa without any recorded outbreaks. We searched for homotomids and their parasitoids on eight Ficus species on the east coast of Australia, Lord Howe Island (LHI), and in Auckland, New Zealand, and detected them on three Ficus species. Using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, we delimited three Mycopsylla species, including a putative new species on F.watkinsiana. We also characterised six (including one previously described) parasitoid species of the genus Psyllaephagus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) based on congruent morphological characters and molecular data. Each of the homotomid species was highly host specific to a single fig species, whereas parasitoid species varied in host specificity: three host specific to M.fici and three host generalists. Geographic distribution varied among parasitoid species; e.g. one host-specific species was found on both the mainland and LHI, but a second species only on LHI. Our study revealed previously unrecognised diversity in fig homotomids and especially in their parasitoids. The herbivores and parasitoids showed contrasting patterns of host specificity. Interestingly, M.fici, the only outbreak species, had the highest diversity of associated parasitoid species and was the only species with host-specific parasitoids.},

Here, we reconstruct an expanded ant phylogeny representing 82\% of ant genera, compile a new family-wide trait database, and conduct various trait-based analyses to show that defensive traits in ants do exhibit an evolutionary trade-off. In particular, the use of a functional sting negatively correlates with a suite of other defensive traits including spines, large eye size, and large colony size. Furthermore, we find that several of the defensive traits that trade off with a sting are also positively correlated with each other and drive increased diversification, further suggesting that these traits form a defensive suite. Our results support the hypothesis that trade-offs in defensive traits significantly constrain trait evolution and influence species diversification in ants.},

A lectotype is designated for C. chloromelas. A Chilean Patagonian population of C. moscosensis n. sp. was observed to dig spatially clumped nests in an earth bank with a moderately hard and humid soil.

	abstract = {The bumblebees of the subgenus Mendacibombus of the genus Bombus are the sister group to all other extant bumblebees and are unusual among bees for specialising in some of the highest elevation habitats with entomophilous plants on Earth. Most named taxa in this group (24 available names, from a total of 49 published names) were described originally from small differences in the colour pattern of the hair, many as parts (e.g. subspecies) of just one species. Subsequent taxonomic treatments recognised multiple species, but have described very few morphological characters, most of which are in the male genitalia. We examined 4413 specimens representing all of the named taxa from throughout the group's global range to describe variation in DNA, in skeletal morphology, and in the colour patterns of the hair. Using Bayesian inference of the phylogeny from an evolutionary model for the fast-evolving COI gene, and fitting either general mixed Yule/coalescent models or Poisson tree process models, we identify COI gene coalescents, which are expected to characterise species as evolutionarily independent lineages. None of the conditions most likely to compromise this interpretation (biased sampling, paralogy, introgression, heteroplasmy, incomplete lineage sorting) appears to be a substantial problem in this case. In an integrative analysis, we show that colour patterns are often variable within these groups and do not diagnose the same groups as we recognise from genes; in contrast, the groups recognised from gene coalescents can also be diagnosed from differences we identify in morphology. We infer that the 12 groups with coalescents in the COI gene that are corroborated by morphology constitute species, whereas many of these species are polymorphic in colour pattern. Lectotypes are designated for 15 taxa in order to reduce uncertainty in the identity and application of the names. We provide new morphological keys and distribution maps for the species. Then we use four genes (fast-evolving mitochondrial COI and 16S; and slower nuclear PEPCK and opsin) to obtain an absolute chronogram of phylogenetic relationships among the species. From published estimates that the most recent common ancestor of the subgenus Mendacibombus diverged from the other bumblebees at the beginning of the Oligocene, our results support the crown group of Mendacibombus as having diversified in the late Miocene, events that both appear to have been associated with periods of climate cooling. Relative conservatism in the alpine/ subalpine climate niche of Mendacibombus, as compared with the much more diversified climate niches in the sister group of all other bumblebees, may have contributed to constraining the number of Mendacibombus species to just one twentieth of the total number of extant bumblebee species.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ympev.2016.08.020},
	abstract = {Some species of Cataglyphis desert ants have evolved a hybridogenetic mode of reproduction at the social scale. In hybridogenetic populations, two distinct genetic lineages coexist. Non-reproductive offspring (workers) are hybrids of the two lineages, whereas sexual offspring (males and new queens) are produced by parthenogenesis and belong to the mother queen lineage. How this unusual reproductive system affects phylogeographic patterns and speciation processes remains completely unknown to date. Using one mitochondrial and four nuclear genes, we examined the phylogenetic relationships between three species of Cataglyphis (C. hispanica, C. humeya and C. velox) where complex DNA inheritance through social hybridogenesis may challenge phylogenetic inference. Our results bring two important insights. First, our data confirm a hybridogenetic mode of reproduction across the whole distribution range of the species C. hispanica. In contrast, they do not provide support for hybridogenesis in the populations sampled of C. humeya and C. velox. This suggests that these populations are not hybridogenetic, or that hybridogenesis is too recent to result in reciprocally monophyletic lineages on nuclear genes. Second, due to mitochondrial introgression between lineages (Darras and Aron, 2015), the faster-evolving COI marker is not lineage specific, hence, unsuitable to further investigate the segregation of lineages in the species studied. Different mitochondrial haplotypes occur in each locality sampled, resulting in strongly structured populations. This micro-allopatric structure leads to over-splitting species delimitation on mitochondrial gene, as every locality could potentially be considered a putative species; haploweb analyses of nuclear markers, however, yield species delimitations that are consistent with morphology. Overall, this study highlights how social hybridogenesis varies across species and shapes complex phylogeographic patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To investigate the species-specificity between figs and fig pollinators and to further understand the speciation process in obligate mutualisms, we examined the genetic differentiation and phylogenetic relationships of four closely related fig-pollinating wasp species (Blastophaga nipponica, Blastophaga taiwanensis, Blastophaga tannoensis and Blastophaga yeni) in Japan and Taiwan using genome-wide sequence data, including mitochondrial DNA sequences. In addition, population structure was analysed for the fig wasps and their host species using microsatellite data. The results suggest that the three Taiwanese fig wasp species are a single panmictic population that pollinates three dioecious fig species, which are sympatrically distributed, have large differences in morphology and ecology and are also genetically differentiated. Our results illustrate the first case of pollinator sharing by host shift in the subgenus Ficus. On the other hand, there are strict genetic codivergences between allopatric populations of the two host-pollinator pairs. The possible processes that produce these pollinator-sharing events are discussed based on the level and pattern of genetic differentiation in these figs and fig wasps.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1471-2148},
	doi = {10.1186/s12862-016-0797-7},
	abstract = {Background: There is great controversy as to whether Microsporidia undergo a sexual cycle. In the paradigmatic case of Nosema ceranae, although there is no morphological evidence of sex, some meiosis-specific genes are present in its reduced genome and there is also high intraspecific variability, with incongruent phylogenies having been systematically obtained. The possibility of sexual recombination is important from an epidemiological standpoint, particularly as N. ceranae is considered to be a major factor in the current disquieting epidemic of widespread bee colony losses. This parasite apparently originated in oriental honey bees, spreading out of Asia and Australia to infect honey bees worldwide. This study had three main objectives: i) to obtain genetic markers that are not part of known multi-copy arrays for strain determination; ii) to shed light on the intraspecific variability and recombination of N. ceranae; and iii) to assess the variability in N. ceranae populations. The answers to these questions are critical to understand the capacity of adaptation of microsporidia. Results: Biallelic polymorphisms were detected at a number of specific points in the five coding loci analyzed from European and Australian isolates of N. ceranae. Heterozygous genotypes were abundant and cloning experiments demonstrate that they reflect the existence of multiple alternative sequences in each isolate. The comparisons of different clones and genotypes clearly indicate that new haplotypes are generated by homologous recombination. Conclusions: The N. ceranae isolates from honey bees correspond to genotypically distinct populations, revealing that individual honey bees may not be infected by a particular clone but rather, a pool of different strains. Homologous recombination implies the existence of a cryptic sex cycle yet to be described in N. ceranae. There are no diagnostic alleles associated with Australian or European origins, nor are there differences between the two hosts, A. cerana and A. mellifera, supporting the absence of biological barriers for N. ceranae transmission. Diversity is high among microsporidia of both these origins, and the maintenance of a high heterozygosis in the recently invaded European populations, could hypothetically underlie the stronger virulence of N. ceranae observed in A. mellifera.},

All protein-coding genes start with ATN codons. Eleven protein-coding genes presented TAA stop codons, whereas ND6 and COII that presented TA, and T nucleotides, respectively. The gene pattern revealed extensive rearrangements compared to the typical pattern generally observed in insects. These rearrangements involve two protein-coding and two ribosomal genes, along with the 16 tRNA genes. This gene order is different from the pattern described for Ibalia leucospoides (Ibaliidae, Cynipoidea), suggesting that this particular gene order can be variable among Cynipoidea superfamily members.

In both species, all of the 37 typical mitochondrial genes were determined. The secondary structure of tRNA genes and rRNA genes were predicted and compared with those of other insects. Atypical trnS1 using abnormal anticodons TCT and lacking D-stem pairings was identified. There were 49 helices belonging to six domains in rrnL and 30 helices belonging to three domains in rrns present. Compared with the ancestral organization, four and two tRNA genes were rearranged in mitochondrial genomes of Auplopus and Agenioideus, respectively. In both species, trnM was shuffled upstream of the trnI-trnQ-trnM cluster, and trnA was translocated from the cluster trnA-trnR-trnN-trnS1-trnE-trnF to the region between nad1 and trnL1, which is novel to the Vespoidea. In Auplopus, the tRNA cluster trnW-trnC-trnY was shuffled to trnW-trnY-trnC. Phylogenetic analysis within Vespoidea revealed that Pompilidae and Mutillidae formed a sister lineage, and then sistered Formicidae. The genomes presented in this study have enriched the knowledge base of molecular markers, which is valuable in respect to studies about the gene rearrangement mechanism, genomic evolutionary processes and phylogeny of Hymenoptera.},

Traditionally, their sister group has been considered to be the Ichneumonoidea; however, recent phylogenetic analyses contradict this hypothesis. We evaluate three potential candidates for the sister group of aculeate wasps: Ichneumonoidea, Evanioidea and Trigonaloidea. This is addressed by investigating the internal head anatomy of representatives of the relevant taxa, specifically the tentorium, musculature and glands. One species each of the families Braconidae, Evaniidae, Gasteruptiidae, Aulacidae and Trigonalidae, as well as Sphecidae and Sapygidae as representatives of Aculeata, and Ibaliidae as outgroup is examined. 33 head anatomical characters are mapped on the three competing hypotheses. Aculeata + Evanioidea are corroborated by the presence of a secondary bridge, the presence of a subforaminal cup and the presence of one medial sulcus on the ventral head sclerotisation instead of two sublateral ones. Trigonaloidea + (Aculeata + Evanioidea) is corroborated by the presence of a bent cibarium. The presence of a hypopharyngeal gland, the backwards shift of the origin of the antennal muscles, the loss of the connection of the dorsal tentorial arms with the head capsule and the loss of ventral salivarial dilators are retrieved as synapomorphies of Aculeata. Two hitherto unknown glands, a hypopharyngeal salivary gland in Sphecidae and Sapygidae and a hypopharyngeal-maxillary gland in Evaniidae, are described.},

Corynura Spinola and Halictillus Moure (Halictidae: Augochlorini) contain species that are key elements in southern South American ecosystems. These bees are very difficult to identify due to close morphological similarity among species and high sexual dimorphism. We analyzed 170 barcode-compliant COI sequences from 19 species. DNA barcodes were useful to confirm gender associations and to detect two new cryptic species. Interspecific distances were significantly higher than those reported for other bees. Maximum intraspecific divergence was less than 1\% in 14 species. Barcode index numbers (BINs) were useful to identify putative species that need further study. More than one BIN was assigned to five species. The name Corynura patagonica (Cockerell) probably refers to two cryptic species. The results suggest that Corynura and Halictillus species can be identified using DNA barcodes. The sequences of the species included in this study can be used as a reference to assess the identification of unknown specimens.

	abstract = {Cryptic species complexes cause major challenges for taxonomists and alter understanding of species diversity. In Northern Europe, the Chrysis ignita species group is one such complex with numerous sympatric sibling species. The objective of this paper is to assess the taxonomy of 15 species from this group using three different approaches: molecular, morphological and trophic differentiation. The analysed set of molecular markers included a 7400-bp-long sequence of the mitochondrial genome covering complete sequences of CO1, CO2, ATP8, ATP6, CO3, ND3, 16S and 12S rRNA, nine tRNAs and a partial sequence of CytB, as well as a 3880-bp-long sequence of the nuclear DNA covering a part of 18S rRNA, the ITS1, 5.8S rRNA, ITS2 and a part of 28S rRNA. Discrete diagnostic characters of each species sequence were retrieved using the Characteristic Attribute Organisation System algorithm and a molecular identification key was compiled. The study revealed a higher evolutionary rate of the genes ATP8, ATP6, CO3, ND3 and CytB compared to that of CO1, CO2 and 16S; the studied nuclear markers demonstrated a lower evolutionary rate than the mitochondrial markers. A consensus tree compiled based on the combined mtDNA and nuclear markers with a strongly supported topology resolved the position of the C.schencki-C. parietissp.n. clade as sister to the C.ignita-C.impressa clade and supported the monophyly of the C.angustula-C.longula clade. We compiled a morphometric species identification key applying linear discriminant equations. The trophic differentiation was assessed using data on host preferences of ten Chrysis species reared from trap-nests; the analysis demonstrated that most of them are specialists exploiting a single or a few taxonomically related host species. In most cases, all three approaches supported the distinct status of the included species. Moreover, two previously undescribed species were consistently supported by the molecular methods. Therefore, we describe these as new, namely C.horridulasp.n. and C.parietissp.n. Only C.mediata and C.solida were not clearly distinguished using the molecular phylogeny reconstruction methods. However, based on distinctive niche divergence, the presence of molecular characters and morphometric differences, we consider them as phylogenetically young but distinct species. In view of the weak morphological and molecular differentiation, the widely overlapping distribution areas and often similar habitat preferences and the trophic specialization, the C.ignita complex presents a possible model for studies of sympatric cryptic speciation.

The Polysphincta group was recovered as monophyletic, although relationships between genera were different from previous hypotheses based on morphological data. Within the Polysphincta group, three major clades were recognized and phylogenetic relationships among them were well resolved as (Schizopyga subgroup + (Acrodactyla subgroup + Polysphincta subgroup)). The Schizopyga subgroup consisted of the genera Piogaster, Schizopyga, Zabrachypus and Brachyzapus. As the genus Schizopyga was found to be polyphyletic, the genus Dreisbachia, which had been synonymized under Schizopyga, was resurrected and Ianiagen.n. is proposed for Dreisbachia pictifrons, to maintain monophyletic genera. Species of the Schizopyga subgroup utilize spiders constructing egg-laying chambers or funnel webs as hosts. The genus Piogaster was not recovered as the sister to all other members of the genus group, unlike previous hypotheses, but was nested in this clade as (Zabrachypus + ((Brachyzapus + Schizopyga) + (Dreisbachia + (Iania + Piogaster)))). Members of the Acrodactyla and Polysphincta subgroups attack spiders that weave aerial webs. The host range of the former is centred on tetragnathid and linyphiid spiders, the host range of the latter seems to centre mainly on orb-weaving araneids and partly on theridiids weaving three-dimensional (3D) irregular webs. Based on the obtained phylogeny of the group, the evolution of larval and cocoon morphology, and the mode of parasitism are discussed.

We examine here one of the largest bee genera, the genus Megachile - the dauber and leafcutting bees. Besides presenting a phylogeny based on five nuclear genes (5480 aligned nucleotide positions), we attempt to use the phylogenetic signal of mitochondria] DNA barcodes, which are rapidly accumulating and already include a substantial proportion of the known species diversity in the genus. We used barcodes in two ways: first, to identify particularly divergent lineages and thus to guide taxon sampling in our nuclear phylogeny; second, to augment taxon sampling by combining nuclear markers (as backbone for ancient divergences) with DNA barcodes. Our results indicate that DNA barcodes bear phylogenetic signal limited to very recent divergences (3-4 my before present). Sampling within clades of very closely related species may be augmented using this technique, but our results also suggest statistically supported, but incongruent placements of some taxa. However, the addition of one single nuclear gene (LW-rhodopsin) to the DNA barcode data was enough to recover meaningful placement with high Glade support values for nodes up to 15 million years old. We discuss different proposals for the generic classification of the tribe Megachilini. Finding a classification that is both in agreement with our phylogenetic hypotheses and practical in terms of diagnosability is particularly challenging as our analyses recover several well supported clades that include morphologically heterogeneous lineages. We favour a classification that recognizes seven morphologically well-delimited genera in Megachilini: Coelioxys, Gronoceras, Heriadopsis, Matangapis, Megachile, Noteriades and Radoszkowskiana. Our results also lead to the following classification changes: the groups known as Dinavis, Neglectella, Ewymeda and Phaenosarus are reestablished as valid subgenera of the genus Megachile, while the subgenus Alocanthedon is placed in synonymy with M. (Callomegachile), the subgenera Parachalicodoma and Largella with M. (Pseudomegachile), Anodonteutricharaea with M. (Paracella), Platysta with M. (Eurymella), and Grosapis and Eumegachile with M. (Megachile) (new synonymies). In addition, we use maximum likelihood reconstructions of ancestral geographic ranges to infer the origin of the tribe and reconstruct the main dispersal routes explaining the current, cosmopolitan distribution of this genus.

Since there are several species, strains, and ecotypes available, correct identification is the first step for successful biological control programs. Morphological identification remains complex due to subtle difference in male genetalia, therefore alternative molecular techniques were employed for rapid and reliable identification of this group of parasitoids. Furthermore, many of the field collected specimens are females, which are not identifiable using morphological keys. This study was carried out to unravel the discrimination success in the two molecular marker loci cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region of trichogrammatids. In achieving these objectives, the single specimen of 22 trichogrammatids belonging to 19 species were subjected to DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing. Additionally, we obtained homologous sequences from GenBank and sequences in BOLD database to understand internal relationships between the trichogrammatids. Bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis conducted with 84 and 76 sequences of COI and ITS-2 loci respectively and studied discrimination among the different species. Based on trees in comparison, we observed that there was a total of 10 and 6 out of 19 species correctly discriminate with COI and ITS-2 respectively. Our result revealed that the ITS-2 gene was less divergent than the COI gene in the majority of species and failed to differentiate all terminal clades. Therefore, we recommend that COI is suitable as the primary DNA barcode locus in trichogrammatids. Overall, we suggest that COI gene has higher discrimination power and can be considered as an appropriate molecular marker for species identification in trichogrammatids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In the more species-rich groups, this percentage might be even larger, which is certainly the case in parasitoid wasps which have received very little attention by taxonomists. The genus Pristomerus of the family Ichneumonidae is distributed worldwide, with most species found in the tropics. Its members attack concealed larvae of small Lepidoptera, and several species are used in biocontrol. Five species have been reported from Australia, all of them endemic, but many more undescribed species are present in various collections. I here revise Australian Pristomerus, focussing on the species that bear a tooth on the ventral side of the hind femur. Twenty-two species are recorded, 19 of which are described as new: Pristomerus australiensis n. sp., P. bertschmanni n. sp., P. callitrinus n. sp., P. dundeei n. sp., P. flavicephalus n. sp., P. fourecksensis n. sp., P. gracilis n. sp., P. kakaduensis n. sp., P. laetus n. sp., P. luculentus n. sp., P. lunatus n. sp., P. mangiferus n. sp., P. merus n. sp., P. nedkellyi n. sp., P. pellicius n. sp., P. periculosus n. sp., P. stellatus n. sp., P. tenebrosus n. sp., and P. venustus n. sp. A dichotomous key and an online interactive key to the known Australian species with a tooth on the hind femur are provided, including photographs of all the species. The origin of the considerable number of Australian Pristomerus species remains unclear. They might represent Southern relict elements with affinities to South American taxa, or their ancestors might have immigrated from the Paleotropics in more recent times; this question can only be solved with a dated phylogeny of the genus. However, support for a Palaeotropic origin of at least a good portion of the taxa comes from their current distribution, as the Australian Pristomerus are found to be most diverse in the tropical habitats of Northern Queensland and the Northern Territories.},

Here, we undertook large-scale sequencing of mitochondrial genomes from a worldwide collection of specimens belonging to Braconidae, one of the largest families of Metazoa. The strand-asymmetry of base composition in the mitochondrial genomes of braconids is reversed, providing evidence for monophyly of the Braconidae. We have reconstructed a backbone phylogeny of the major lineages of Braconidae from gene order of the mitochondrial genomes. Standard phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences provided strong support for both Cyclostomes and Noncyclostomes. Four subfamily complexes, that is, helconoid, euphoroid, sigalphoid, and microgastroid, within the Noncyclostomes were reconstructed robustly, the first three of which formed a monophyletic group sister to the last one. Aphidiinae was recovered as a lineage sister to other groups of Cyclostomes, while the Ichneutinae was recovered as paraphyletic. Separate analyses of the subdivided groups showed congruent relationships, employing different matrices and methods, for the internal nodes of the Cyclostomes and the microgastroid complex of subfamilies. This research, using multiple lines of evidence from mitochondria' genomes, illustrates multiple uses of mitochondrial genomes for phylogenetic inference in Braconidae.},

Apis florea is phylogenetically the most basal honey bee species and also the most distant sister species to the Western honey bee Apis mellifera, for which all OR genes had been identified before. Using our pipeline, we identified 180 OR genes inA. florea, which is very similar to the number of ORs identified inA. mellifera (177 ORs). Many characteristics of the ORs including gene structure, synteny of tandemly repeated ORs and basic phylogenetic clustering are highly conserved. The composite phylogenetic tree of A. florea and A. mellifera ORs could be divided into 21 clades which are in harmony with the existing Hymenopteran tree. However, we found a few nonorthologous OR relationships between both species as well as independent pseudogenization of ORs suggesting separate evolutionary changes. Particularly, a subgroup of the OR gene clade XI, which had been hypothesized to code cuticular hydrocarbon receptors showed a high number of species-specific ORs. RNAseq analysis detected a total number of 145 OR transcripts in male and 162 in female antennae. Most of the OR genes were highly expressed on the female antennae. However, we detected five distinct male-biased OR genes, out of which three genes (AfOr11, AfOr18, AfOr170P) were shown to be male-biased in A. mellifera, too, thus corroborating a behavioral function in sex-pheromone communication.},

While morphology and ecology define most species, the species limits of a group in the Eastern United States are unclear. In particular, the morphological and behavioural characters of A.carolinensis, A.picea and A.rudis overlap. These observations suggest that these three species are not monophyletic. We therefore tested the monophyly of Aphaenogaster in the context of molecular phylogenetic analyses. We used DNA data from five genes: CO1, CAD, EF1F2, long-wavelength rhodopsin and wingless, to reconstruct phylogenies for 44 Aphaenogaster and outgroup species. In the resulting trees, reconstructed using parsimony and Bayesian inference, species boundaries associated with well-supported monophyletic clades of individuals in most of the 23 North American Aphaenogaster collected from multiple locations. However, some clades were unresolved, and both A.picea and A.rudis were not monophyletic. Although this may indicate that clades of multiple species represent fewer but morphologically varied species, given the short branch lengths, the lack of resolution may reflect the fact that these ants have recently radiated, and a lack of gene lineage sorting explains the non-monophyly of species. Additional biological information concerning pre- and postmating barriers is needed before a complete revision of species boundaries for Aphaenogaster.},

We generated a data set of 944 loci of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) to reconstruct the phylogeny of 41 representatives of 23 Acropyga species using both concatenation and species-tree approaches. We investigated the biogeographic history of the genus through divergence dating analyses and ancestral range reconstructions. We also explored the evolution of the Acropyga-mealybug mutualism using ancestral state reconstruction methods. We recovered a highly supported species phylogeny for Acropyga with both concatenation and species-tree analyses. The age for crown-group Acropyga is estimated to be around 30 Ma. The geographic origin of the genus remains uncertain, although phylogenetic affinities within the subfamily Formicinae point to a Paleotropical ancestor. Two main Acropyga lineages are recovered with mutually exclusive distributions in the Old World and New World. Within the Old World Glade, a Palearctic and African lineage is suggested as sister to the remaining species. Ancestral state reconstructions indicate that Old World species have diversified mainly in close association with xenococcines from the genus Eumyrmococcus, although present-day associations also involve other mealybug genera. In contrast, New World Acropyga predominantly evolved with Neochavesia until a recent (10-15 Ma) switch to rhizoecid mealybug partners (genus Rhizoecus). The striking mandibular variation in Acropyga evolved most likely from a 5-toothed ancestor. Our results provide an initial evolutionary framework for extended investigations of potential co-evolutionary interactions between these ants and their mealybug partners. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular markers were analysed separately and combined, with or without the adjunction of a matrix of 62 morphological characters using Bayesian inference. Our results reveal three distinct lineages, each including one of most speciose genera: Ophion, Enicospilus and Thyreodon. The comparison of the molecular data, and combined molecular plus morphological data led to the definition of the three tribes: Ophionini stat. rev. ( Ophion + Alophophion + Rhopalophion + Xylophion + Afrophion); Enicospilini stat. rev. ( Enicospilus + Laticoleus + Dicamptus + Hellwigiella); and Thyreodonini tribe nov.

Ophion is a polyphyletic assemblage and requires a further revision to define the delimitation with close genera. The enigmatic Old World genus Skiapus is strongly supported as belonging to the Ophioninae, although its placement within the subfamily is ambiguous as a result of its derived genotype and phenotype. Finally, we propose a biogeographical scenario supported by this phylogeny and based on the limited available fossil data. (C) 2016 The Linnean Society of London},

	abstract = {Background: Nasonia vitripennis is an emerging insect model system with haplodiploid genetics. It holds a key position within the insect phylogeny for comparative, evolutionary and behavioral genetic studies. The draft genomes for N. vitripennis and two sibling species were published in 2010, yet a considerable amount of transcriptiome data have since been produced thereby enabling improvements to the original (OGS1.2) annotated gene set. We describe and apply the EvidentialGene method used to produce an updated gene set (OGS2). We also carry out comparative analyses showcasing the usefulness of the revised annotated gene set. Results: The revised annotation (OGS2) now consists of 24,388 genes with supporting evidence, compared to 18,850 for OGS1.2. Improvements include the nearly complete annotation of untranslated regions (UTR) for 97 \% of the genes compared to 28 \% of genes for OGS1.2. The fraction of RNA-Seq validated introns also grow from 85 to 98 \% in this latest gene set. The EST and RNA-Seq expression data provide support for several non-protein coding loci and 7712 alternative transcripts for 4146 genes. Notably, we report 180 alternative transcripts for the gene lola. Nasonia now has among the most complete insect gene set; only 27 conserved single copy orthologs in arthropods are missing from OGS2. Its genome also contains 2.1-fold more duplicated genes and 1.4-fold more single copy genes than the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The Nasonia gene count is larger than those of other sequenced hymenopteran species, owing both to improvements in the genome annotation and to unique genes in the wasp lineage. We identify 1008 genes and 171 gene families that deviate significantly from other hymenopterans in their rates of protein evolution and duplication history, respectively. We also provide an analysis of alternative splicing that reveals that genes with no annotated isoforms are characterized by shorter transcripts, fewer introns, faster protein evolution and higher probabilities of duplication than genes having alternative transcripts. Conclusions: Genome-wide expression data greatly improves the annotation of the N. vitripennis genome, by increasing the gene count, reducing the number of missing genes and providing more comprehensive data on splicing and gene structure. The improved gene set identifies lineage-specific genomic features tied to Nasonia's biology, as well as numerous novel genes.

For studying taxonomy and phylogeny of fossil insects, venational patterns are commonly used as diagnostic characters, in conjunction with preserved body characters. Some examples of asymmetrical venation are known among extant insects, but only a few fossil insects with asymmetric wings have been reported, among which a previously described xyelotomid of Hymenoptera, Xyelocerus diaphanous, displays an unusual, small cell of vein Rs in the left forewing, but not in the right. Results: Herein we report a new sawfly of the family Xyelotomidae, Aethotoma aninomorpha gen. et sp. nov., from the late Middle Jurassic of China having a simple Sc in the forewing and Sc with two branches in the hind wing. In additional, the new specimen exhibits an enigmatic venational asymmetry. In the right forewing, crossvein 2r-rs of forms a loop, then forks into 2 long branches reaching Rs, while 2r-rs of the left forewing forks into 2 short branches reaching Rs, in contrast to a linear 2r-rs in typical fossil and extant sawflies. Conclusion: Such rare asymmetrical venation found from fossil sawflies provides a glance at early occurrences of venational variability and instability, or possibly aberrational development, for insects in the late Middle Jurassic.},

Recently, quantification of its shape using landmarks has increased the potential of wing venation to distinguish taxa. However, the use of wing landmarks in phylogenetic analyses remains largely unexplored. Here, we tested landmark analysis under parsimony (LAUP) to include wing shape data in a phylogenetic analysis of hornets and yellow jackets. Using 68 morphological characters, nine genes and wing landmarks, we produced the first total-evidence phylogeny of Vespinae. We also tested the influence of LAUP parameters using simulated landmarks. Our data confirmed that optimization parameters, alignment method, landmark number and, under low optimization parameters, the initial orientation of aligned shapes can influence LAUP results. Furthermore, single landmark configurations never accurately reflected the topology used for data simulation, but results were significantly close when compared to random topologies. Thus, wing landmark configurations were unreliable phylogenetic characters when treated independently, but provided some useful insights when combined with other data. Our phylogeny corroborated the monophyly of most groups proposed on the basis of morphology and showed the fossil Palaeovespa is distantly related to extant genera. Unstable relationships among genera suggest that rapid radiations occurred in the early history of the Vespinae. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2015.},

	abstract = {Cataglyphis desert ants display unique variation in their breeding systems, making this genus a particularly interesting model to study the evolution of derived reproductive traits in eusocial Hymenoptera. Colonies may be headed by a single or several queens, and queens may be singly or multiply mated. Furthermore, in a number of species, both the workers and queens do reproduce asexually by thelytokous parthenogenesis. We examined whether the variability in reproductive traits is the result of a single evolutionary transition or of multiple independent evolutionary transitions, per trait. First, we inferred a phylogenetic estimate for the genus by analyzing DNA sequence variation among several species at four independent loci. Our phylogenetic hypothesis confirms the monophyly of previously defined species groups. Second, we examined the evolution of four reproductive traits in the genus (queen mating frequency, colony queen number, as well as worker reproduction and queen reproduction by thelytokous parthenogenesis), by inferring the state of these traits at the ancestral nodes. Our results show that polyandry and monogyny are the most likely conditions for the ancestor of the genus; the status of worker and queen thelytoky remains ambiguous. Genetic diversity within colonies may have been a major driver for the evolution of derived reproductive traits in Cataglyphis. Kinship among group members has long been recognized as a main factor promoting the evolution of sociality and reproductive altruism. In eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps), at least three reproductive characteristics were shown to profoundly affect colony kin structure and may have played a key role in the evolution and maintenance of reproductive altruism: the queen mating frequency, the number of reproductive queens in a colony, and reproduction by parthenogenesis. We infer the evolution of these three reproductive traits in Cataglyphis desert ants, a genus displaying considerable variation in reproductive strategies. We propose a phylogenetic estimate for the genus, from variation at four loci. Then, we show that multiple evolutionary changes occurred for all three reproductive characters studied. Our results suggest that selection for enhanced colony genetic diversity has driven the evolution of reproductive traits away from their ancestral state.},

	abstract = {Parasitoid wasps of the subfamily Cheloninae are both species rich and poorly known. Although the taxonomy of Cheloninae appears to be relatively stable, there is no clear understanding of relationships among higher-level taxa. We here applied molecular phylogenetic analyses using three markers (COI, EF1 alpha, 28S) and 37 morphological characters to elucidate the evolution and systematics of these wasps. Analyses were based on 83 specimens representing 13 genera. All genera except Ascogaster, Phanerotoma, and Pseudophanerotoma formed monophyletic groups; Furcidentia (sta. rev.) is raised to generic rank. Neither Chelonus (Chelonus) nor Chelonus (Microchelonus) were recovered as monophyletic, but together formed a monophyletic lineage. The tribes Chelonini and Odontosphaeropygini formed monophyletic groups, but the Phanerotomini sensu Zettel and Pseudophanerotomini were retrieved as either para- or polyphyletic. The genera comprising the former subfamily Adeliinae were confirmed as being nested within the Cheloninae. To estimate the age of the subfamily, we used 16 fossil taxa. Three approaches were compared: fixed-rate dating, node dating, and total-evidence dating, with age estimates differing greatly between the three methods. Shortcomings of each approach in relation to our dataset are discussed, and none of the age estimates is deemed sufficiently reliable. Given that most dating studies use a single method only, in most cases without presenting analyses on the sensitivity to priors, it is likely that numerous age estimates in the literature suffer from a similar lack of robustness. We argue for a more rigorous approach to dating analyses and for a faithful presentation of uncertainties in divergence time estimates. Given the results of the phylogenetic analysis the following taxonomic changes are proposed: Furcidentia Zettel (stat. rev.), previously treated as a subgenus of Pseudophanerotoma Zettel is raised to generic rank; Microchelonus Szepligeti (syn. nov.), variously treated by previous authors, is proposed as a junior synonym of Chelonus Jurine; the following subgenera of Microchelonus- Baculonus Braet \& van Achterberg (syn. nov.), Carinichelonus Tobias (syn. nov.) and Scabrichelonus He, Chen \& van Achterberg (syn. nov.), are proposed as junior synonyms of Chelonus; a number of new species names are proposed due to homonyms resulting from the above changes and these are listed in the paper.

Males of L heterotoma produce (+)-isoiridomyrmecin, which is also used for chemical defense. In this study we show that females and males of L. heterotoma produce the iridomyrmecins in a pair of mandibular glands. Each gland consists of a secretory part composed of class 3 gland cells and their accompanying duct cells, as well as a reservoir bordered by a thin intima. The gland discharges between the mandible base and the clypeus. Males have considerably smaller glands than females, which corresponds to the lower amount of iridomyrmecins produced by males. Chemical analyses of the mandibular gland contents showed that the gland of females contained mainly (-)-iridomyrmecin, as well as low amounts of the other previously described iridoid pheromone compounds, while the glands of males contained only (+)-isoiridomyrmecin.

The primary structure of this peptide, code-named Olisa-AKH, is elucidated as pEVNFSPNWGG amide. It is a novel member of the AKH family and in its synthetic form it has strong hypertrehalosemic activity in the American cockroach. This effect may be explained by its near-identical structure compared with one of the endogenous cockroach AKH peptides. An analog with the reversed order of the proline and asparagine residues, viz.

From reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography experiments, we can conclude that the CC from an individual webspinner contains less than one pmol of Olisa-AKH.

There is longstanding debate over the biogeographical history of the genus, with the Palaearctic and Neotropical regions proposed as alternate centres of origin. We propose a resolution of this debate with the recent discovery and analysis of an extant species from central Brazil, L. relictussp.n., which we describe from workers, males and brood. We sequence ten nuclear genes in the new species and in several Australian Leptomyrmex species, and append these data to a 54-taxon, 10-gene data matrix previously generated for the subfamily Dolichoderinae. We conduct phylogenetic and divergence dating analyses, and re-evaluate the fossil record of the group. We recover Leptomyrmex relictussp.n. as a member of the Leptomyrmex clade with high support. It is sister to the Australasian species, and the genus Leptomyrmex is, in turn, sister to a pair of Neotropical genera, Forelius and Dorymyrmex. We infer a Neotropical origin for the genus and estimate a mid-Eocene (46 Ma, 95\% CI 56 to 36 Ma) origin for the crown genus and an Oligocene origin for the Australasian clade (29 Ma, 95\% CI 40 to 19 Ma). We confirm placement of the Dominican amber species dagger L. neotropicus Baroni Urbani in the genus but reject a close relationship with the Palaearctic fossil taxa dagger Leptomyrmula Emery and dagger Usomyrma Dlussky, Radchenko \& Dubovikoff, considering them incertae sedis in the subfamily (Dolichoderinae). In contrast to the mesophilic preferences of the Australasian species of Leptomyrmex, the new Brazilian species inhabits cerrado (dry savannah). Our results support a Neotropical origin for spider ants with dispersal to Australia. Rafting on west-bound currents and/or a historical diversity imbalance between Australia and South America are proposed as alternate hypotheses to explain a pattern of biased E-W mid-Tertiary dispersal for ants with austral distributions. This pattern is suggested by our results in conjunction with observations of other ant clades. Overall, our findings highlight the value of integrated taxonomy, critical interpretation of morphology, and a comparative phylogenetic framework when conducting palaeontological and biogeographical studies of insect species.

	abstract = {The ants in the subfamily Amblyoponinae are an old, relictual group with an unusual suite of morphological and behavioural features. Adult workers pierce the integument of their larvae to imbibe haemolymph, earning them the vernacular name dracula ants'. We investigate the phylogeny of this group with a data set based on 54 ingroup taxa, 23 outgroups and 11 nuclear gene fragments (7.4 kb). We find that the genus Opamyrma has been misplaced in this subfamily: it is a member of the leptanilline clade and sister to all other extant Leptanillinae. Transfer of Opamyrma to Leptanillinae renders the Amblyoponinae monophyletic. The enigmatic Afrotropical genus Apomyrma is sister to all other amblyoponines, and the latter cleave into two distinct and well-supported clades, here termed POA and XMMAS. The POA clade, containing Prionopelta, Onychomyrmex and Amblyopone, is well resolved internally, and its structure supports synonymy of the genus Concoctio under Prionopelta (syn.n.). The XMMAS clade comprises two well-supported groups: (i) a predominantly Neotropical clade, for which we resurrect the genus name Fulakora (stat.r., stat.n.), with junior synonyms Paraprionopelta (syn.n.) and Ericapelta (syn.n.); and (ii) the remaining taxa, or core XMMAS', which are manifested in our study as a poorly resolved bush of about a dozen lineages, suggesting rapid radiation at the time of their origin. Most of these XMMAS lineages have been assigned to the catch-all genus Stigmatomma, but the more distinctive elements have been treated as separate genera (Xymmer, Mystrium, Myopopone and Adetomyrma). Resolution of basal relationships in the core XMMAS clade and reconfiguration of Stigmatomma' to restore monophyly of all named genera will require more extensive genetic data and additional morphological analysis. However, the genus Bannapone can be synonymized under Stigmatomma (syn.n.) because it is embedded within a clade that contains S. denticulatum, the type species of Stigmatomma. Divergence dating analysis indicates that crown Amblyoponinae arose in the mid-Cretaceous, about 107 Ma (95\% highest probability density: 93-121 Ma). The POA and XMMAS clades have estimated crown ages of 47 and 73 Ma, respectively. The initial burst of diversification in the core XMMAS clade occurred in the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene (50-60 Ma). Ancestral range reconstruction suggests that amblyoponines originated in the Afrotropics, and dispersed to the Indo-Malayan region and to the New World. During none of these dispersal events did the ants break out of their cryptobiotic lifestyle.},

	abstract = {Ants comprise one lineage of the triumvirate of eusocial insects and experienced their early diversification within the Cretaceous [1-9]. Their ecological success is generally attributed to their remarkable social behavior. Not all ants cooperate in social hunting, however, and some of the most effective predatory ants are solitary hunters with powerful trap jaws [10]. Recent evolutionary studies predict that the early branching lineages of extant ants formed small colonies of ground-dwelling, solitary specialist predators [2, 5, 7, 11, 12], while some Cretaceous fossils suggest group recruitment and socially advanced behavior among stem-group ants [9]. We describe a trap-jaw ant from 99 million-year-old Burmese amber with head structures that presumably functioned as a highly specialized trap for large-bodied prey. These are a cephalic horn resulting from an extreme modification of the clypeus hitherto unseen among living and extinct ants and scythe-like mandibles that extend high above the head, both demonstrating the presence of exaggerated morphogenesis early among stem-group ants. The new ant belongs to the Haidomyrmecini, possibly the earliest ant lineage [9], and together these trap-jaw ants suggest that at least some of the earliest Formicidae were solitary specialist predators. With their peculiar adaptations, haidomyrmecines had a refined ecology shortly following the advent of ants.},

Here, we present the first data on the secondary structural properties of ITS2 in sawflies and test its utility as a molecular identifier in Tenthredopsis (Tenthredinidae: Symphyta). The ITS2 regions were sequenced from 67 specimens representing 14 species and six morphotypes of Tenthredopsis and their secondary structure were predicted and characterised. A sequence-structural alignment dataset of ITS2 was analysed by application of maximum likelihood method to see relationship among the specimens. Here, a relaxed approach has been adapted to identify and to elucidate species boundaries by considering the presence of CBCs, hemi-CBCs and unique length size of ITS2 in combination with morphology. The predicted secondary structure of ITS2 was extremely branched in contrast to common core structure found in many eukaryotes. A likely protein binding side was detected in Helix III and suggested to be a synapomorphy for Tenthredinidae. Eighteen species were identified under the relaxed approach applied here, of which Tenthredopsis lactiflua (Klug, 1817), Tenthredopsis ornata (Serville, 1823), Tenthredopsis stigma (Fabricius, 1798) and Tenthredopsis coquebertii (Klug, 1817) are new records for Turkey. The structural properties and length size of ITS2 prove useful in determination of species boundaries of closely related species.

In the present study, we explore the duplication and rearrangement of tRNA genes in the mt genome of Reduvius tenebrosus, the first mt genome from the subfamily Reduviinae. The gene order rearranges from CR (control region)-trnI-trnQ-trnM-ND2 to CR-trnQ-trnI2-trnI1-trnM-ND2. We identified 23 tRNA genes, including 22 tRNAs commonly found in insects and an additional trnI (trnI2), which has high sequence similarity to trnM. We found several pseudo genes, such as pseudo-trnI, pseudo-CR, and pseudo-ND2, in the hotspot region of gene rearrangement (between the control region and ND2). These features provided evidence that this novel gene order could be explained by the tandem duplication/random loss (TDRL) model. The tRNA duplication/anticodon mutation mechanism further explains the presence of trnI2, which is remolded from a duplicated trnM in the TDRL process (through an anticodon mutation of CAT to GAT). Our study also raises new questions as to whether the two events proceed simultaneously and if the remolded tRNA gene is fully functional. Significantly, the duplicated tRNA gene in the mitochondrial genome has evolved independently at least two times within assassin bugs.},

The file and scraper that make up the SO are specialized morphological features not used for functions other than stridulation (a vibratory signal production mechanism) and not found in non-stridulating species. It has been hypothesized and generally accepted that the stridulatory organ first evolved to alert nest mates of burial and need for rescue. Based on this premise, arboreal species are expected to exhibit a reduction of use of vibrational signals when compared to terrestrial species. Using ancestral state reconstruction, we have mapped the presence of the SO on a molecular phylogeny of the ants and found support for the hypothesis that the SO evolved multiple times in the ants. We quantitatively tested the hypothesis that stridulation evolved initially to signal burial/rescue by comparing the presence of the SO to general foraging and nesting preferences for 76 genera evenly spread throughout the currently accepted ant phylogeny. We found that a greater proportion of genera that are considered primarily arboreal possess a SO, as opposed to the ground nesting genera, and none of the five entirely subterranean genera included in this study possess a SO. We therefore reject the previous hypothesis regarding burial/rescue signaling.},

	abstract = {Feeding in insect parasitoids can have significant implications from behavioral and evolutionary ecology standpoints. Females of many species not only search for hosts to lay their eggs on, but also may use them as a food source. Host-feeding, as this behavior is known, occurs mostly in the Hymenoptera. There is some evidence of benefits of host feeding at the intraspecific level, but there are only few studies of the potential association between host feeding behavior and life-history traits across hymenopteran parasitoids. The main goal of this paper is to test for correlated evolution of host feeding and various other life-history traits, aiming for an understanding of the diversity of parasitoid life histories. For this, we performed a comparative analysis based mainly on phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), using data for 187 species of hymenopteran parasitoids, and (1) examined whether host-feeding behavior is correlated with life span, lifetime potential fecundity, and maximum egg load, (2) re-tested the potential evolutionary correlation suggested by Jervis etal. [Journal of Animal Ecology 70 (2001) 442] between host feeding and the ovigeny index (OI), and (3) re-tested the possible correlation between lifetime potential fecundity and life span across species and examined whether host feeding affects this relationship. Results indicate a positive evolutionary correlation between host feeding and both life span and maximum egg load, and a negative evolutionary correlation between host feeding and OI. Lifetime potential fecundity does not correlate with host feeding but correlates positively with life span. The effect of the interaction between host feeding and life span on potential fecundity was not significant. Ashas been noted in the past, the array of correlations between traits suggests the existence of adaptive suites of life-history traits involving trade-offs based on resource allocation patterns.},

However, we observed that parasitized individuals of Achaearanea tingo attacked by Z. alborhombarta change the three-dimensional structure of their webs to a very simple and strong structure composed of two cables attached to the surrounding vegetation. This structure holds the curled leaf formerly used by the spider as a shelter. The parasitoid larva remains protected within this shelter after killing the host. The architectural pattern of the cocoon webs of A. tingo indicates that host manipulation is characterized by the repetition of one specific subroutine involved in web construction.

We suggest that the common ancestors of major insect groups like Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Holometabola experience more gene gain than gene loss. This suggests that as major insect groups arose, their genomic repertoire expanded through gene duplication (segmental duplications), followed by contraction by gene loss in specific terminal lineages. In addition, we examine the functional significance of the loss and gain of genes in the divergence of some of the major insect groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Among the doryctine taxa that are endemic to this region, there is a group of six genera (the Pedinotus genus group) that are mainly characterized by having lateral, posteriorly converging or subparallel grooves on the second metasomal tergite (including Gymnobracon Szepligeti, Hybodoryctes Szepligeti, Lamquetia Braet et van Achterberg, Osmophila Szepligeti, Pedinotus Szepligeti and Trigonophasmus Enderlein). Most of these genera were described more than a century ago, and thus their limits and diagnostic morphological features are not well defined. We present an analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among various representative species of five of the six genera belonging to the Pedinotus genus group based on one mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) and two nuclear (28S, Wingless) gene markers. We also estimated the timing of origin and diversification within the group and investigated the external morphology of the genera involved in order to determine reliable identification characters. The group as a whole, whilst being recovered as monophyletic with the inclusion of Acanthorhogas Szepligeti, was not statistically supported. However, the respective monophyly of all of the morphologically supported genera are confirmed, as are the intergeneric relationships (Gymnobracon, Trigonophasmus) ((Acanthorhogas, Osmophila) (Lamquetia, Pedinotus)). We propose that the pattern of sublateral grooves or depressions appears to be a useful systematic character for recognition of an endemic Neotropical radiation that could have originated c. 41-27 Ma.

Within this group of ants Crematogaster borneensis Andre, 1896 (with five subspecies and four varieties), Crematogaster captiosa Forel, 1910 as well as Crematogaster decamera Forel, 1910 have previously been described from SE Asia. Here we synonymise C. borneensis subsp. capax Forel, 1911, C. borneensis subsp. hosei Forel, 1911, C. borneensis subsp. sembilana Forel, 1911, and C. borneensis var. macarangae Viehmeyer, 1916 with C. borneensis Andre, 1896. Crematogaster borneensis var. harpyia Forel, 1911, C. borneensis var. insulsa Forel, 1911, C. borneensis subsp. symbia Forel, 1911, and C. borneensis subsp. novem Forel, 1911 are synonymised with C. captiosa Forel, 1910. In addition we describe five new species: C. claudiae sp. nov., C. hullettii sp. nov., C. linsenmairi sp. nov., C. maryatii sp. nov., and C. roslihashimi sp. nov.. Seven of these eight species are placed into two informal species subgroups based on queen morphology, life-history characters and a formerly published molecular phylogeny. Keys are provided for the identification of queens and workers, as well as natural history information on the eight ant species. The morphology of these Macaranga-associated Crematogaster (formerly Decacrema) species is compared to the only other three species described for this former subgenus in SE Asia, i.e. C. angulosa Andre, 1896, C. biformis Andre, 1892 and C. cephalotes Smith, 1857.},

	abstract = {Reproductive division of labor is one of the crucial features in social insects, however, the developmental mechanisms leading to modifications in the reproductive apparatus of workers are still not very clear. Ants show a remarkable diversity in the morphological specialization of the worker's reproductive apparatus, that allows to distinguish four types, type 1: workers that have ovaries and a functional spermatheca, and that reproduce like queens, type 2: workers have ovaries and a vestigial spermatheca, type 3: workers have ovaries but no spermatheca, and type 4: workers lost both ovaries and spermatheca. We investigated morphogenesis of the worker spermatheca in 28 ant species by histological examination. In workers of type 1, the morphogenesis of the spermatheca is very similar to that in ant queens. In type 2, the spermathecal disc also differentiates, however, the development is interrupted and remains vestigial. In types 3 and 4, the absence of the spermatheca in the adult phase is caused by a degeneration after initial formation of the spermathecal disc or by a complete lack of the spermathecal discs. The timing of these interruption and degeneration events varies among species. The species exhibiting an earlier interrupting point of spermatheca formation in workers have a larger queen-worker dimorphism, that seems to be independent from ant phylogeny.},

Its systematics has remained poorly understood because of a lack of modern revisionary work. Crematogaster (Orthocrema) is revised for the Asian region, and 27 species including ten new species are recognized. Five species groups: the C. baduvi group (4 spp.); the C. binghamii group (3 spp.); the C. biroi group (10 spp.); the C. moatensis group (1 sp.); the C. quadriruga group (9 spp.) are established based on worker caste morphology. A key to Asian species of the subgenus Orthocrema based on the worker caste is given. Phylogenetic relationships of Asian Orthocrema are analyzed. The analysis revealed that the C. baduvi-, C. binghamii-, and C. biroi groups are monophyletic, and that the allopatric distribution patterns of closely related species imply that Asian Orthocrema is composed of relatively young taxa. There have been at least three west-to-east dispersal events across Wallace's line in the C. baduvi-, C. quadriruga- and C. biroi groups.(c) 2016 The Linnean Society of London},

The small carpenter bee genus Ceratina occurs globally, and is represented in North America by its most recently diverged subgenera, Ceratinula and Zadontomerus. Recent genetic analysis of eastern Ceratina (Zadontomerus) supports the existence of five closely related, yet genetically distinct species living in sympatry. This phylogeographical study employs molecular barcoding of the most comprehensive specimen collection yet assembled to confirm the identities of these recently diverged eastern North American Ceratina (Zadontomerus) species. Delineation of extant population structure, evolutionary history and known range of this emerging model native pollinator are greatly improved by this study.

	abstract = {Across terrestrial ecosystems, modern ants are ubiquitous. As many as 94 out of every 100 individual arthropods in rainforests are ants [1], and they constitute up to 15\% of animal biomass in the Amazon [2, 3]. Moreover, ants are pervasive agents of natural selection as over 10,000 arthropod species are specialized inquilines or myrmecomorphs living among ants or defending themselves through mimicry [4, 5]. Such impact is traditionally explained by sociality: ants are the first major group of ground-dwelling predatory insects to become eusocial [3], increasing efficiency of tasks and establishing competitive superiority over solitary species [6, 7]. A wealth of specimens from rich deposits of 99 million-year-old Burmese amber resolves ambiguity regarding sociality and diversity in the earliest ants. The stem-group genus Gerontoformica maintained distinct reproductive castes including morphotypes unknown in solitary aculeate (stinging) wasps, providing insight into early behavior. We present rare aggregations of workers, indicating group recruitment as well as an instance of interspecific combat; such aggression is a social feature of modern ants. Two species and an unusual new genus are described, further expanding the remarkable diversity of early ants. Stem-group ants are recovered as a paraphyletic assemblage at the base of modern lineages varying greatly in size, form, and mouthpart structure, interpreted here as an adaptive radiation. Though Cretaceous stem-group ants were eusocial and adaptively diverse, we hypothesize that their extinction resulted from the rise of competitively superior crown-group taxa that today form massive colonies, consistent with Wilson and Ho “lldobler's concept of “dynastic succession.”},

	abstract = {Due to their widespread distribution, range of adaptations, local abundance, and species diversity, ants are a major component of terrestrial communities worldwide. However, such high ecological prevalence is not shared among all ant lineages, with four ant genera Camponotus, Pheidole, Strumigenys, and Crematogaster accounting for a disproportionately large share of ant diversity. As a consequence, the study of variation in ant diversity has hitherto focused on testing whether more species-rich clades or regions are associated with disproportionately higher speciation and / or lower extinction rates. In this study, we investigate an intriguing but largely overlooked phenomenon in ants: the existence of ancient, species-poor lineages. We used both analytical and simulation results to assess evolutionary scenarios that could lead to current levels of ant diversity. We found that such relictual lineages are highly unlikely given constant rate models of speciation and extinction. In particular, such old, species-poor lineages are much more likely to either go extinct, or to generate more species than currently observed. The possible mechanisms leading to such relictual lineages are discussed, particularly with respect to current scenarios of early ant evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {Background: The ecological differentiation of insects with parasitic life-style is a complex process that may involve phylogenetic constraints as well as morphological and/or behavioural adaptations. In most cases, the relative importance of these driving forces remains unexplored. We investigate here this question for the “Eupelmus urozonus species group” which encompasses parasitoid wasps of potential interest in biological control. This was achieved using seven molecular markers, reliable records on 91 host species and a proxy of the ovipositor length. Results: After using an adequate partitioning scheme, Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches provide a well-resolved phylogeny supporting the monophyly of this species group and highlighting its subdivision into three sub-groups. Great variations of both the ovipositor length and the host range (specialist versus generalist) were observed at this scale, with these two features being not significantly constrained by the phylogeny. Ovipositor length was not shown as a significant predictor of the parasitoid host range. Conclusions: This study provides firstly the first evidence for the strong lability of both the ovipositor's length and the realised host range in a set of phylogenetically related and sympatric species. In both cases, strong contrasts were observed between sister species. Moreover, no significant correlation was found between these two features. Alternative drivers of the ecological differentiation such as interspecific interactions are proposed and the consequences on the recruitment of these parasitoids on native and exotic pests are discussed.},

	abstract = {The generic classification of Neotropical Eumeninae has been termed chaotic, and synonymisation of taxa has become constant in recent years. Recognition of some generic limits are problematic due to features showing a great deal of variation, such as the length of the first metasomal tergum. This applies to the Neotropical Alphamenes van der Vecht, Minixi Giordani Soika and Pachyminixi Giordani Soika. Minixi has already been demonstrated to be paraphyletic in regards to Pachyminixi. These taxa are the focus of the present study, which used morphological data to infer the phylogenetic relationships among their constituent species. A total of 14 taxa and 34 characters were subjected to cladistic analysis under implied weighting. A single most-parsimonious cladogram was obtained, recovering Pachyminixi as monophyletic. Minixi, however, was paraphyletic relative to Pachyminixi and they are thus synonymised, with the former name having priority. A new species from Mexico, Minixi mariachii, sp. nov., is described. Minixi joergenseni bicingulatus (Zavattari, 1912) is synonymised under M. joergenseni (Schrottky, 1909), comb. nov. Additional new combinations are: Minixi arechavaletae (Brethes, 1903), comb. nov., M. bifasciatum (von Schulthess, 1904), comb. nov., M. brethesi (Bertoni, 1927), comb. nov., M. sumichrasti (de Saussure, 1875), comb. nov., and M. uruguyense (de Saussure, 1855), comb. nov. Illustrations and a new key to species of Minixi are provided. The present study enhances our knowledge on Neotropical potter wasp systematics, providing one further step into a natural classification for a group whose taxonomy has suffered from irrational splitting of genera in the past century.},

Despite the diversity of the subgenus Neoceratina in the Oriental and Indo-Malayan region, Ceratina (Neoceratina) australensis is the only ceratinine species in Australia. We examine the biogeography and demography of C. australensis using haplotype variation at 677 bp of the barcoding region of COI for specimens sampled from four populations within Australia, across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. There is geographic population structure in haplotypes, suggesting an origin in the northeastern populations, spreading to southern Australia. Bayesian Skyline Plot analyses indicate that population size began to increase approximately 18,000 years ago, roughly corresponding to the end of the last glacial maximum. Population expansion then began to plateau approximately 6,000 years ago, which may correspond to a slowing or plateauing in global temperatures for the current interglacial period. The distribution of C. australensis covers a surprisingly wide range of habitats, ranging from wet subtropical forests though semi-arid scrub to southern temperate coastal dunes. The ability of small carpenter bees to occupy diverse habitats in ever changing climates makes them a key species for understanding native bee diversity and response to climate change.},

We find that species of Acropyga present in PNG diversified during the Pliocene, between six and two million years ago. Most species now exhibit a patchy distribution that does not show a strong signal of geological history. However, the population genetic structure of the widespread species A. acutiventris has been influenced by geography, habitat association and, possibly, historical habitat fragmentation. There is a significant effect of isolation-by-distance within continuous lowland forest, and proximity to Australia has had a larger impact in structuring populations of A. acutiventris in PNG than has the Central Papuan Cordillera.

While there have been some attempts to divide Ophion into monophyletic species groups, the vast majority of species have been lumped into a single, paraphyletic group, the O. luteus species group, which is defined only by the lack of characters specific to the other groups. The challenging morphology of this large catch-all group has limited attempts to subdivide it, and no phylogenetic hypothesis has been proposed for the genus as a whole. In this study, we use DNA sequence data [28S ribosomal RNA (28S), cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)] to present the first molecular phylogeny of Ophion. We also describe the secondary structure of ITS2 for the first time in Ichneumonidae, and explore its implications for phylogeny estimation.

The C. atrox A+T-rich region, at 1402 bp, was the longest of all sequenced ant genomes and was composed of an identical tandem repeat consisting of six 100-bp copies and one 96-bp copy. A total of 315 bp of intergenic spacer sequence was spread over 23 regions. An alignment of the spacer sequences in ants was largely feasible among congeneric species, and there was substantial sequence divergence, indicating their potential use as molecular markers for congeneric species. The A/T contents at the first and second codon positions of protein-coding genes (PCGs) were similar for ant species, including C. atrox (73.9\% vs. 72.3\%, on average). With increased taxon sampling among hymenopteran superfamilies, differences in the divergence rates (i. e., the non-synonymous substitution rates) between the suborders Symphyta and Apocrita were detected, consistent with previous results. The C. atrox mt genome had a unique gene arrangement, trnI-trnM-trnQ, at the A+T-rich region and ND2 junction (underline indicates inverted gene). This may have originated from a tandem duplication of trnM-trnI, resulting in trnM-trnI-trnM-trnI-trnQ, and the subsequent loss of the first trnM and second trnI, resulting in trnI-trnM-trnQ},

The inner phylogenetic relationships of Epicharis agree with the current taxonomic classification. In Centris, three main clades were recovered, namely the Centris, Trachina and Melacentris groups. Inner relationships in Centris suggest the reinstatement of some subgenera and proposition of new ones. Early diversification of Centris and Epicharis took place at the tropical regions of South America. Epicharis and the Melacentris group in Centris mostly diversified in that region, expanding over Central America and tropical North America only recently in the last 3 My.

Field work was conducted in the Silesian Beskid Mountains in 2011-2013. The fungus was found on four species of ants: Lasius niger L, Lasius brunneus Latr., Formica lemani Bondr. and Formica fusca L. The first three species have not been noted previously in the literature as hosts of Aegeritella fungi. The infection rate ranged from 1\% for Formica lemani to 21\% for L. brunneus. Molecular analysis based on ITS and SSU rDNA sequences revealed close relationships between Aegeritella and Trichosporon isolates. We conclude that the genus Aegeritella-inceratae sedis until now, should be placed within the fungal group Basidiomycota, Tremellomycetes, Tremellomycetidae, Tremellales, Trichosporonaceae.

	abstract = {Pompilinae is one of the largest subfamilies of spider wasps (Pompilidae). Most pompilines are generalist spider predators at the family level, but some taxa exhibit ecological specificity (i.e., to spider-host guild). Here we present the first molecular phylogenetic analysis of Pompilinae, toward the aim of evaluating the monophyly of tribes and genera. We further test whether changes in the rate of diversification are associated with host-guild shifts. Molecular data were collected from five nuclear loci (28S, EF1-F2, LWRh, Wg, Pol2) for 76 taxa in 39 genera. Data were analyzed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). The phylogenetic results were compared with previous hypotheses of subfamilial and tribal classification, as well as generic relationships in the subfamily. The classification of Pompilus and Agenioideus is also discussed. A Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis was used to examine divergence times. Diversification rate-shift tests accounted for taxon-sampling bias using ML and BI approaches. Ancestral host family and host guild were reconstructed using MP and ML methods. Ancestral host guild for all Pompilinae, for the ancestor at the node where a diversification rate-shift was detected, and two more nodes back in time was inferred using BI. In the resulting phylogenies, Aporini was the only previously proposed monophyletic tribe. Several genera (e.g., Pompilus, Microphadnus and Schistonyx) are also not monophyletic. Dating analyses produced a well-supported chronogram consistent with topologies from BI and ML results. The BI ancestral host-use reconstruction inferred the use of spiders belonging to the guild “other hunters” (frequenting the ground and vegetation) as the ancestral state for Pompilinae. This guild had the highest probability for the ML reconstruction and was equivocal for the MP reconstruction; various switching events to other guilds occurred throughout the evolution of the group. The diversification of Pompilinae shows one main rate-shift coinciding with a shift to ground-hunter spiders, as reconstructed by the BI ancestral character-state analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Cobweb spiders (Theridiidae) are highly diverse from the perspective of species richness, morphological diversity, variety of web architecture, and behavioral repertoires. The family includes over 50\% of social spiders, a behavioral rarity among the order, and members of the family are furthermore the subject of research on venom, silk biomechanics, kleptoparasitism and web building, among other traits. Theridiidae is one of the most abundant groups of spiders, and thus key insect predators in many different ecosystems and is among relatively few spider families that show high degree of myrmecophagy. Modern comparative studies on all these fronts are best buttressed on a phylogenetic foundation. Our goal here is to offer a revised, dated, phylogenetic hypothesis for the family by summarizing previously published data from multiple molecular and morphological studies through data-mining, and adding novel data from several genera. We also test the hypothesis that the origin and diversification of cobweb spiders coincides with that of ants on which many species specialize as prey. The new phylogeny is largely congruent with prior studies and current taxonomy and should provide a useful tool for theridiid classification and for comparative analyses. Nevertheless, we also highlight the limitations of currently available data the state of the art in Theridiidae phylogenetics offering weak support for most of the deeper nodes in the phylogeny. Thus the need is clear for modern phylogenomic approaches to obtain a more solid understanding, especially of relationships among subfamilies. We recover the monophyly of currently recognized theridiid subfamilies with the exception of some enigmatic `pholcommatines' (Styposis, Phoroncidia) and putative `hadrotarsines' (Audifia, Tekellina) whose placement is uncertain in our analyses. Theridiidae dates back some 100 mya to the Cretaceous, a period of diversification in flowering plants and many groups of insects, including ants. The origin of cobweb spiders, and hence the cobweb-a speciallized trap for pedestrian prey-coincides with a major diversification shift in ants. The family becomes abundant in fossil record 50-40 mya as ants also diversify and reach dominance and contemporary patterns of abundances of theridiids and ants show the same trends, with increasing relative abundance towards the equator and at lower altitudes. We find that among orbiculariae, lineages that specialize on ant prey are non-randomly clustered within Theridiidae. Given these findings we hypothesize that the origin of the gumfoot web was a stepping stone that facilitated the capture of ants and resulted in specialized myrmecophagy in a number of `basal' theridiids. We also document a subsequent loss in myrmecophagy, and associated increase in speciation rates, as `recent' theridiid groups evolve diverse web forms and many return to the capture of aerial prey.

	abstract = {Background: Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been successfully used in phylogenom cs for a variety of taxa, but their power in phylogenetic inference has yet to be extensively compared with that of traditional Sanger sequencing data sets. Moreover, UCE data on invertebrates, including insects, are sparse. We compared the phylogenetic informativeness of 959 UCE loci with a multi-locus data set of ten nuclear markers obtained via Sanger sequencing, testing the ability of these two types of data to resolve and date the evolutionary history of the second most species-rich subfamily of ants in the world, the Formicinae. Results: Phylogenetic analyses show that UCEs are superior in resolving ancient and shallow relationships in ormicine ants, demonstrated by increased node support and a more resolved phylogeny. Phylogenetic informativeness metrics indicate a twofold improvement relative to the 10-gene data matrix generated from the identical set of taxa. We were able to significantly improve formicine classification based on our comprehensive UCE phylogeny. Our divergence age estimations, using both UCE and Sanger data, indicate that crovvn-group Formicinae are older (104-117 Ma) than previously suggested. Biogeographic analyses infer that the diversification of the subfamily has occurred on all continents with no particular hub of cladogenesis. Conclusions: We found UCEs to be far superior to the multi-locus data set in estimating form ci le relationships. The early history of the clade remains uncertain due to ancient rapid divergence events that are unresolvable even with our genomic-scale data, although this might be largely an effect of several problematic taxa subtended by long branches. Our comparison of divergence ages from both Sanger and UCE data demonstrates the effectiveness of UCEs for dating analyses. This comparative study highlights both the promise and limitations of UCEs for insect phylogenomics, and will prove useful to the growing number of evolutionary biologists considering the transition from Sanger to next-generation sequencing approaches.},

In this study, we present the most comprehensive analyses of hymenopteran relationships based on 48 mitochondrial (mt) genomes. One complete and two nearly complete mt genomes representing three hymenopteran superfamilies were newly sequenced. We assessed the influence of inclusion/exclusion of 3rd codon positions, alignment approaches, partition schemes and phylogenetic approaches on topology and nodal support within the Hymenoptera. The results showed that the topologies were sensitive to the variation of dataset and analytical approach. However, some robust and highly supported relationships were recovered: the Ichneumonomorpha was monophyletic; the Trigonalyoidea + Megalyroidea and the Diaprioidea + Chalcidoidea were consistently recovered; the Cynipoidea was generally recovered as the sister group to the Diaprioidea + Chalcidoidea. In addition, the monophyletic Aculeata and Proctotrupomorpha were recovered in some analyses. Several gene rearrangements were detected in each of the three newly sequenced mt genomes. Specifically, the lbalia leucospoides mt genome harbors a large inversion of a gene block from trnE to trnS(2). Inverted, duplicated A + T rich regions were detected in the lbalia leucospoides mt genome, which probably played an important role during the formation of the large gene block inversion via recombination.

A morphological phylogenetic analysis provided to test the monophyly of the group using Aleiodes coxalis-group species as the out-group provides evidence for the monophyly of the A. ( Tetrasphaeropyx) group, which is herein classified as a subgenus of Aleiodes Wesmael. A. coxalis-group species were used as the outgroup because previous work has shown that the A. (Tetrasphaeropyx) lineage falls at the apex of the A. coxalis-group. A dichotomous key to all species is provided as well as a glossary of terminology, illustrations referred to in the key, host information, and geographical collection information. Aleiodes (Tetrasphaeropyx) is easily distinguished from other Aleiodes species by the sculptured, carapace-like metasomal tergite IV. Host associations herein reported for about 35\% of all A. (Tetrasphaeropyx) species suggest that the group exclusively attacks larvae of Geometridae.

	abstract = {Alternative phenotypes that differ in body size, shape or other attributes coexist in many animal species, with male-female differences being the most familiar form of alternative phenotypes. Ants are an unappreciated ideal model system to explore allometric interrelationships among alternative phenotypes. Seven different forms of size dimorphism occur within ants, including dimorphisms within and between males and females. In this study I show that a pattern of body size dimorphism parallel to Rensch's rule is found in at least one form of intra-sexual dimorphism, that of the sterile worker castes of ants in the genus Pheidole. I compared the head and pronotum size of major and minor workers of 105 species of New World Pheidole that span the entire range of body size in this genus. Head size of major and minor workers was highly correlated across species (r = 0.84, P {\textless} 0.001), as was pronotum size of the two castes (r = 0.82; P {\textless} 0.0001). Standardized major axis regression of log(head width of major worker) against log(head width of minor worker) showed extreme positive allometry with a slope (beta) of 1.53 (95\% CI = 1.37-1.71), whereas the analogous regression for pronotal width showed significantly less positive allometry with a slope (beta) of 1.22 (95\% CI = 1.10-1.37). When adjusted for phylogenetic autocorrelation using phylogenetically independent contrasts, head width allometry was still strongly positive (beta = 1.36, 95\% CI = 1.21-1.54), whereas pronotal width allometry was isometric beta = 1.09, 95\% CI = 0.94-1.26). I propose several hypotheses to account for positive caste size allometry in ants and suggest that testing them may help point the way to a general class of explanations that encompass both inter- and intrasexual forms of size dimorphism.},

Previous taxonomic treatments have recognized three Western Palaearctic species of Synophrus: S. pilulae, S. politus and S. olivieri. Our results support the establishment of four additional Western Palaearctic species: Synophrus hungaricus sp.n., S. libani sp.n., S. syriacus sp.n. and S. hispanicus sp.n. We describe and diagnose these new taxa, analyse their phylogenetic relationships, and show that Synophrus inquilines are able to impose their own gall phenotypes on those of their hosts.

	abstract = {Figs and fig-pollinating wasps are obligate mutualists that have coevolved for over 60 million years. But when and where did pollinating fig wasps (Agaonidae) originate? Some studies suggest that agaonids arose in the Late Cretaceous and the current distribution of fig-wasp faunas can be explained by the break-up of the Gondwanan landmass. However, recent molecular-dating studies suggest divergence time estimates that are inconsistent with the Gondwanan vicariance hypothesis and imply that long distance oceanic dispersal could have been an important process for explaining the current distribution of both figs and fig wasps. Here, we use a combination of phylogenetic and biogeographical data to infer the age, the major period of diversification, and the geographic origin of pollinating fig wasps. Age estimates ranged widely depending on the molecular-dating method used and even when using the same method but with slightly different constraints, making it difficult to assess with certainty a Gondwanan origin of agaonids. The reconstruction of ancestral areas suggests that the most recent common ancestor of all extant fig-pollinating wasps was most likely Asian, although a southern Gondwana origin cannot be rejected. Our analysis also suggests that dispersal has played a more important role in the development of the fig-wasp biota than previously assumed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, I examine the taxonomy of T melanocephalum and map records from {\textgreater} 1500 sites to evaluate its worldwide spread and probable geographic origin. I document the earliest known T. melanocephalum records for 154 geographic areas (countries, major islands, island groups, US states, and Canadian provinces), including many areas for which I found no previously published records: Anguilla, Antigua \& Barbuda, Barbados, Bonaire, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Comoro Islands, Curacao, Gabon, Gambia, Grenada, Italy, Kenya, Montserrat, Nevis. Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Martin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Tapinoma melanocephalum has one of the widest distributions known for any ant species. It has spread across the Old World and New World in both the northern and southern hemispheres, though at latitudes greater than 30 degrees it is largely restricted to living inside buildings. In most parts of the world, T melanocephalum can be reliably distinguished from other ant species. In India, Southeast Asia, and the western Pacific region, however, T melanocephalum may be confused with closely related taxa, including Tapinoma minutum MAYR, 1862, Tapinoma indicum FOREL, 1895. and several seemingly intermediate forms. suggesting that T. melanocephalum originated in the Indo-Pacific region. Future research on the phylogeny of Tapinoma and on the genetic diversity of T. melanocephalum populations in different parts of the world should help elucidate further the native and exotic ranges of T. melanocephalum.},

Not only has molecular data helped resolve the phylogenetic relationships of many ant groups, but with well-resolved phylogenies inferences about the evolution of morphology, ages of clades, diversification, associations with mutualists, behavior, development, and other areas of research in ant biology have benefited from this active avenue of research. Questions of speciation, population genetics, phylogeography, systematics, biogeography, and many other active lines of ant research are now routinely addressed with molecular data. With the ease of generating large amounts of sequence data increasing and costs decreasing the next frontier in myrmecology will be to insure that future ant biologists are able to take advantage of this important tool while still being trained in basic ant biology and taxonomy.},

	abstract = {An hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships of Asilidae and its constituent taxa is presented, combining morphological and DNA sequence data in a total evidence framework. It is based on 77 robber fly species, 11 Asiloidea outgroup species, 211 morphological characters of the adult fly, and approximately 7300 bp of nuclear DNA from five genes (18S and 28S rDNA, AATS, CAD, and EF-1 alpha protein-encoding DNA). The equally weighted, simultaneous parsimony analysis under dynamic homology in POY resulted in a single most parsimonious cladogram with a cost of 27,582 (iterative pass optimization; 27,703 under regular direct optimization). Six of the 12 included subfamily taxa are recovered as monophyletic. Trigonomiminae, previously always considered as monophyletic based on morphology, is shown to be non-monophyletic. Two of the three Trigonomiminae genera, Holcocephala Jaennicke, 1867 and Rhipidocephala Hermann, 1926, group unexpectedly as the sister taxon to all other Asilidae. Laphriinae, previously seen in the latter position, is the sister group of the remaining Asilidae. Five other subfamily taxa, i.e. Brachyrhopalinae, Dasypogoninae, Stenopogoninae, Tillobromatinae, and Willistonininae, are also shown to be non-monophyletic. The phylogenetic relationships among the higher-level taxa are partly at odds with findings of a recently published morphological study based on more extensive taxon sampling. The total evidence hypothesis is considered as the most informative one, but the respective topologies from the total-evidence, morphology-only, and molecular-only analyses are compared and contrasted in order to discuss the signals from morphological versus molecular data, and to analyze whether the molecular data outcompete the fewer morphological characters. A clade Apioceridae + Mydidae is corroborated as the sister taxon to Asilidae. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Biologische Systematik. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The bumblebee species, Bombus, is an invaluable natural resource for greenhouse pollination. Low levels of genetic variation of Bombus m-dens have been reported in a previous mitochondrial (mt) gene study. In this study, we sequenced the complete internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of the nuclear rDNA obtained from 100 B. ardens individuals collected from several Korean localities, in an effort to assess its usefulness in characterizing the genetic diversity and relationships among populations of B. ardens. The ITS2 sequences of B. m-dens were shown to be longest among known insects, ranging in size from 1,971 - 1,984 bp. The sequences harbor four duplicated repeats-similar to 27 bp repeats, similar to 20 bp repeats, similar to 33 bp repeats, and similar to 34 bp repeats-which have never before been reported in other insect ITS2 rDNA The maximum sequence divergence of 1.01\% among 96 sequence types confirmed the applicability of this molecule to the Study of intraspecific variation, revealing higher sequence variation as compared to the previously studied mt COT gene. Overall, a very high per generation migration ratio (Nm = 5.83 similar to infinite) and a very low level of genetic fixation (F-ST = 0 - 0.08) were noted to exist among populations of B. ardens. The high estimation of gene flow among most populations-in particular, between the remote island Ulleungdo and several inland populations-suggest that historical events may be more responsible for the contemporary population structure of B. ardens. The finding of the lowest genetic diversity (pi) in the population on Ulleungdo Island (pi = 0.007434) may be reflective of a relatively small population size and the geographical isolation of the population as compared with other inland populations.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jip.2009.05.012},
	abstract = {Globalization has provided opportunities for parasites/pathogens to cross geographic boundaries and expand to new hosts. Recent studies showed that Nosema ceranae, originally considered a microsporidian parasite of Eastern honey bees, Apis cerana, is a disease agent of nosemosis in European honey bees, Apis mellifera, along with the resident species, Nosema apis. Further Studies indicated that disease caused by N. ceranae In European honey bees is far more prevalent than that caused by N. apis. In order to gain more insight into the epidemiology of Nosema parasitism in honey bees, we conducted studies to investigate infection of Nosema in its original host, Eastern honey bees, using conventional PCR and duplex real time quantitative PCR methods. Our results showed that A. cerana was infected not only with N. ceranae as previously reported [Fries, L, Feng, F., Silva, A.D., Slemenda, S.B., Pieniazek, N.J., 1996. Nosema ceranae n. sp. (Microspora, Nosematidae), morphological and molecular characterization of a microsporidian parasite of the Asian honey bee Apis cerana (Hymenoptera, Apidae). Eur. J. Protistol. 32, 356-365], but also with N. apis. Both microsporidia produced single and mixed infections. Overall and at each location alone, the prevalence of N. ceranae was higher than that of N. apis. In all cases of mixed infections, the number of N. ceranae gene copies (corresponding to the parasite load) significantly out numbered those of N. apis. Phylogenetic analysis based on a variable region of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSUrRNA) showed four distinct clades of N. apis and five clades of N. ceranae and that geographical distance does not appear to influence the genetic diversity of Nosema populations. The results from this study demonstrated that duplex real-time qPCR assay developed in this study is a valuable tool for quantitative measurement of Nosema and can be used to monitor the progression of microsprodian infections of honey bees in a timely and cost efficient manner.

We combined these data with nine previously sequenced hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes. This allowed us to infer and analyze the evolution of the 67 mitochondrial gene rearrangements so far found in this order. All of these involve tRNA genes, whereas four also involve larger (protein-coding or ribosomal RNA) genes. We find that the vast majority of mitochondrial gene rearrangements are independently derived. A maximum of four of these rearrangements represent shared, derived organizations, whereas three are convergently derived. The remaining mitochondrial gene rearrangements represent new mitochondrial genome organizations. These data are consistent with the proposal that there are an enormous number of alternative mitochondrial genome organizations possible and that mitochondrial genome organization is, for the most part, selectively neutral. Nevertheless, some mitochondrial genes appear less mobile than others. Genes close to the noncoding region are generally more mobile but only marginally so. Some mitochondrial genes rearrange in a pattern consistent with the duplication/random loss model, but more mitochondrial genes move in a pattern inconsistent with this model. An increased rate of mitochondrial gene rearrangement is not tightly associated with the evolution of parasitism. Although parasitic lineages tend to have more mitochondrial gene rearrangements than nonparasitic lineages, there are exceptions (e.g., Orussus and Schlettererius). It is likely that only a small proportion of the total number of mitochondrial gene rearrangements that have occurred during the evolution of the Hymenoptera have been sampled in the present study.},

Phylogenetic relationships within this family are poorly understood and some genera cannot be placed with confidence at the subfamily level. We analysed melittid phylogeny using a combined dataset of five nuclear genes [28S, elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha, F-2 copy), long-wavelength rhodopsin, Na-K ATPase and RNA polymerase II] spanning 4842 bp plus 68 adult morphological characters. Our study included 25\% of the species-level diversity and 81\% of the generic-level diversity and included all previously recognized tribes and subfamilies. We analysed the dataset using parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. All methods yielded congruent results. All topologies recovered the three previously recognized subfamilies (Dasypodainae, Melittinae, Meganomiinae), but two genera (Afrodasypoda and Promelitta) are transferred from Dasypodainae to Melittinae. On the basis of our tree topologies we identify four tribes (Dasypodaini comb.n., Hesperapini stat.n., Macropidini comb.n. and Melittini), only one of which (Melittini) matches a widely used classification. Lastly, we discuss the evolution of host-plant association in the light of our new phylogenetic hypothesis. Our results strongly support multiple independent origins of oil-collecting behaviour in the Melittinae.},

Atta species have long attracted the attention of naturalists, and have since become a common model system for the study of complex insect societies as well as for the study of coevolutionary dynamics due to their numerous interactions with fungi and other microbes. Nevertheless, systematics and taxonomy of the 15 species in the genus Atta have proven challenging, due in part to the extreme levels of worker polymorphism these species display, leading to disagreements about the validity of as many as five different subgenera and calling into question the monophyly of the genus. Here, we use DNA sequence information from fragments of three mitochondrial genes (COI, tRNA leucine and COII) and one nuclear gene (EF1-alpha F1), totaling 1070 base pairs, to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of Atta species using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference techniques. Our results provide support for monophyly of the genus Atta, and suggest that the genus is divided into four monophyletic groups, which correspond to four of the five previously erected Atta subgenera: Atta sensu stricto and Archeatta, each with species composition identical to earlier proposals; Neoatta and Epiatta, with major differences in species composition from earlier proposals. The current geographic ranges of these species suggest that the historical separation of South America from Central and North America has played a role in speciation within this genus.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-9-99},
	abstract = {Background: The increase in availability of genomic sequences for a wide range of organisms has revealed gene duplication to be a relatively common event. Encounters with duplicate gene copies have consequently become almost inevitable in the context of collecting gene sequences for inferring species trees. Here we examine the effect of incorporating duplicate gene copies evolving at different rates on tree reconstruction and time estimation of recent and deep divergences in butterflies. Results: Sequences from ultraviolet-sensitive (UVRh), blue-sensitive (BRh), and long-wavelength sensitive (LWRh) opsins, EF-1 and COI were obtained from 27 taxa representing the five major butterfly families (5535 bp total). Both BRh and LWRh are present in multiple copies in some butterfly lineages and the different copies evolve at different rates. Regardless of the phylogenetic reconstruction method used, we found that analyses of combined data sets using either slower or faster evolving copies of duplicate genes resulted in a single topology in agreement with our current understanding of butterfly family relationships based on morphology and molecules. Interestingly, individual analyses of BRh and LWRh sequences also recovered these family-level relationships. Two different relaxed clock methods resulted in similar divergence time estimates at the shallower nodes in the tree, regardless of whether faster or slower evolving copies were used, with larger discrepancies observed at deeper nodes in the phylogeny. The time of divergence between the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus and the queen D. gilippus (15.3-35.6 Mya) was found to be much older than the time of divergence between monarch co-mimic Limenitis archippus and red-spotted purple L. arthemis (4.7-13.6 Mya), and overlapping with the time of divergence of the co-mimetic passionflower butterflies Heliconius erato and H. melpomene (13.5-26.1 Mya). Our family-level results are congruent with recent estimates found in the literature and indicate an age of 84-113 million years for the divergence of all butterfly families. Conclusion: These results are consistent with diversification of the butterfly families following the radiation of angiosperms and suggest that some classes of opsin genes may be usefully employed for both phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time estimation.},

Acacia ant-plants defended by symbiotic Pseudomyrmex ant mutualists secrete sucrose-free extrafloral nectar, which is unattractive to generalists. We aimed to investigate whether this extrafloral nectar can also exclude exploiters, that is nondefending ant species. Mutualist workers discriminated against sucrose whereas exploiters and generalists with no affinity toward Acacia myrmecophytes preferred sucrose, because mutualist workers lacked the sucrose-cleaving enzyme invertase, which is present in workers of the other two groups. Sucrose uptake induced invertase activity in workers of parasites and generalists, but not mutualists, and in larvae of all species: the mutualists loose invertase during their ontogeny. This reduced metabolic capacity ties the mutualists to their plant hosts, but it does not completely prevent the mutualism from exploitation. We therefore investigated whether the exploiters studied here are cheaters (i.e., have evolved from former mutualists) or parasites (exploiters with no mutualistic ancestor). A molecular phylogeny demonstrates that the exploiter species did not evolve from former mutualists, and no evidence for cheaters was found. We conclude that being specialized to their partner can prevent mutualists from becoming cheaters, whereas other mechanisms are required to stabilize a mutualism against the exploitation by parasites.},

Gall inducers, however, bypass plant toxins and the factors influencing host plant associations in these specialized herbivores remain unclear. We reconstructed the evolution of host plant associations in Western Palaearctic oak gallwasps (Cynipidae: Cynipini), a species-rich lineage of specialist herbivores on oak (Quercus). (1) Bayesian analyses of sequence data for three genes revealed extreme host plant conservatism, with inferred shifts between major oak lineages (sections Cerris and Quercus) closely matching the minimum required to explain observed diversity. It thus appears that the coevolutionary demands of gall induction constrain host plant shifts, both in cases of mutualism (e.g., fig wasps, yucca moths) and parasitism (oak gallwasps). (2) Shifts between oak sections occurred independently in sexual and asexual generations of the gallwasp lifecycle, implying that these can evolve independently. (3) Western Palaearctic gallwasps associated with sections Cerris and Quercus diverged at least 20 million years ago (mya), prior to the arrival of oaks in the Western Palaearctic from Asia 5-7 mya. This implies an Asian origin for Western Palaearctic gallwasps, with independent westwards range expansion by multiple lineages.},

	abstract = {Few complete mitochondrial genomes representing limited families in the order Hymenoptera have been sequenced. Here, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of Diadegma semiclausum (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). This genome is 18 728 bp long, the second largest hexapod mitochondrial genome sequenced in its entirety and that with the highest A+T content at 87.4\%. Four tRNAs are rearranged compared with the ancestral arrangement. Gene rearrangement mechanisms are different among all three rearranged regions. Six tRNAs have a large variable loop, which is not found in other metazoan mitochondrial genomes. trnS((AGY)) uses the abnormal anticodon TCT but trnK uses the normal CTT. The A+T-rich region is very long (2161 bp). An extremely A+T-rich (99.1\%) 1515 bp tandem repeat region with three types of repeat elements is located between cox1 and cox2, and the most likely ancestral element originated from the 3' end of cox1. Independent tandem duplications followed by mutation-insertion-deletion is the best model to explain the formation of this region. These results indicate that independent evolutionary events occurred extensively, such as gene rearrangement events, gene rearrangement mechanisms, derivation of tRNA variable loops, and tandem repeat region evolutionary processes, all of which likely contribute to the diversified features of hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes.},

Although biologists have been fascinated with fungus-growing ants since the resurgence of natural history in the modern era, the early stages of research focused mainly on the foraging behavior of the leaf-cutters (the most derived attine lineage). indeed, the discovery that the ants actually use leaf fragments to manure a fungus did not come until the 1800s. More recently, three additional microbial symbionts have been described, including specialized microfungal parasites of the ant's fungus garden, antibiotic-producing actinobacteria that help protect the fungus garden from the parasite, and a black yeast that parasitizes the ant-actinobacteria mutualism. The fungus-growing ant symbiosis serves as a particularly useful model system for studying insect-microbe symbioses, because, to date, it contains four well-characterized microbial symbionts, including mutualists and parasites that encompass micro-fungi, macro-fungi, yeasts, and bacteria. Here, we discuss approaches for studying insect-microbe symbioses, using the attine ant-microbial symbiosis as our framework. We draw attention to particular challenges in the field of symbiosis, including the establishment of symbiotic associations and symbiont function. Finally, we discuss future directions in insect-microbe research, with particular focus on applying recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies.},

Previously published studies have failed to resolve phylogenetic relationships on a worldwide basis and this has been a major barrier to the progress of research regarding systematics and evolution of colletid bees. For this study, data from four nuclear gene loci: elongation factor-1 alpha (F2 copy), opsin, wingless, and 28S rRNA were analyzed for 122 species of colletid bees, representing all subfamilies and tribes currently recognized; 22 species belonging to three other bee families were used as outgroups. Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and parsimony methods were employed to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within Colletidae and resulted in highly congruent and well-resolved trees. The phylogenetic results show that Colletidae are monophyletic and that all traditionally recognized subfamilies (except Paracolletinae) are also strongly supported as monophyletic. Our phylogenetic hypothesis provides a framework within which broad questions related to the taxonomy, biogeography, morphology, evolution, and ecology of colletid bees can be addressed.

When the sites with insertions/deletions were also taken into account, sequence divergences varied from 0 to 5.3\%. In all pairwise comparisons, the ITS1 sequence from the specimens collected in Goias was most divergent compared to the ITS1 sequences of the bees from the other locations. However, neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis showed that all ITS1 sequences from northeastern specimens along with the sample of Goias were resolved in a single clade with a bootstrap support of 100\%.

The most common mitotype, C12, accounted for 47\% of the Apis mellifera “C” lineage samples and was found in 13 of the 22 sampled locations. This mitotype was also the basal ancestral mitotype based on TCS spanning tree analysis. The greatest amount of genetic diversity was observed in Bursa, where 4 mitotypes of the A. mellifera “C” lineage were unique to this location. Wright's F-statistics revealed that Artvin and Bursa were the most genetically distinct locations relative to the other sampled locations. Applying a molecular clock, Turkish A. mellifera “C” lineage mitotypes have been diverging for approximately 10,000 to 16,500 yr. based on phylogenetic analysis.

We conducted observations in eight reused nests (where a first generation of bees had been produced) kept in artificial boxes from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Five nests were reused ( reactivated) by a single female (SFN), two nests reused by a mother and one daughter (MFN1) and one nest reused by the mother and two daughters (MFN2). No single nest was reactivated by unrelated females. The number of foraging trips, their duration and the duration of cell provisioning was not different between SFN and MFN. The overall production of cells per female was not different either between both types of nest. However, in MFN although all females did lay eggs, there was a reproductive skew in favor of the mother (95 and 45\% of the brood produced in MFN1 and MFN2 respectively). She showed reproductive control of her daughters through oophagy and displaying threatening behavior when the daughters tried to open a cell where she had laid an egg. Brood losses to parasites (Anthrax sp. (Bombyliidae) and Hoplostelis bivittata (Megachilidae)) were only found in SFN which possibly reflects and advantage of MFN in this respect. Our results coupled with other studies in Euglossa, reveal that a wide range of social behaviors occur in this genus, from solitary and communal to primitive reproductive division of labor. Multiple factors involving different levels of pressure imposed by food availability and parasites may favor such a diverse range of nesting behaviors. Interestingly, female associations in E. viridissima seem a result of kin selection that is enforced by coercion from mother females on their daughters. More studies are needed to shed light upon the social organization of Euglossa and other Euglossines and on their phylogenetic relationships in order to trace the origins of eusociality in Apidae.},

	abstract = {Vitellogenins (VgS) are precursors of the major egg storage protein, vitellin (Vn), in many oviparous animals. Insects Vgs are large molecules (similar to 200-kD) synthesized in the fat body in a process that involves substantial Structural modifications (e.g., glycosylation, lipidation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic cleavage, etc.) of the nascent protein prior to its secretion and transport to the ovaries. However, the extent to which Vgs are processed in the fat body varies greatly among different insect groups. We provide evidence by cloning and peptide mapping of four Vg molecules from two cockroach species (Periplaneta americana and Leucophaea maderae) that, in hemimetabolous insects, the pro-Vg is cleaved into several polypeptides (ranging from 50- to 180-kD), unlike the holometabolans where the Vg precursor is cleaved into two polypeptides (one large and one small). An exception is the Vg of Apocrita (higher Hymenoptera) where the Vg gene product remains uncleaved. The yolk Proteins (YPs) of higher Diptera (such as Drosophila) form a different family of proteins and are also not cleaved. So far, VgS have been sequenced from 25 insect species: 9 of them belong to Hemimetabola and 16 to Holometabola. Alignment of the coding sequences revealed that some features, like the GL/ICG motif, cysteine residues, and a DGXR motif upstream of the GLI/CG motif, were highly conserved near the carboxy terminal of all insect Vgs. Moreover,a consensus RXXR cleavage sequence motif exists at the N-terminus of all sequences outside the Apocrita except for Lymantria dispar where it exists at the C-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis using 31 Vg sequences from 25 insect species reflects, in general, the current phylogenies of insects, suggesting that Vgs are still phylogenetically bound, although a divergence exists among them.

	abstract = {Ants live in crowded nests with interacting individuals, which makes them particularly prone to infectious diseases. The question is, How do ants cope with the increased risk of pathogen transmission due to sociality? We have studied the molecular evolution of defensin, a gene encoding an antimicrobial protein, in ants. Defensin sequences from several ant species were analyzed with maximum likelihood models of codon substitution to infer selection. Positive selection was detected in the mature region of defensin, whereas the signal and pro regions seem to be evolving neutrally. We also found a significantly higher rate of nonsynonymous substitutions in some phylogenetic lineages, as well as d(N)/d(S) {\textgreater} 1, suggesting varying selection pressures in different lineages. Earlier studies on the molecular evolution of insect antimicrobial peptide genes have focused on termites and dipteran species, and detected positive selection only in duplicated termicin genes in termites. These findings, together with our present results, provide an indication that the immune systems of social insects (ants and termites) and dipteran insects may have responded differently to the selection pressure caused by microbial pathogens.},

The results show that at all three levels the parasites and hosts are significantly more likely to share similar colour patterns than would be expected by chance in Europe, but not in North America. Parasites do not appear to be significantly more specialised in host choice in Europe than in North America, although there is more evidence of parasite-host co-speciation in Europe than in North America. Parasite-host resemblance appears most likely to be explained by Mullerian mimicry. For the host-specific Psithyrus, the host species might serve as the most influential model because necessarily the host species must co-occur with the parasite and must be common.},

	abstract = {Colletid bees are widely distributed, but most of their diversity is found in southern continents, particularly Australia and South America. A major obstacle for the classification of Colletidae has been the lack of a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis encompassing representatives from all the main lineages of this family. A molecular phylogenetic study recently completed shed light on the subfamilial delimitation and relationships within Colletidae, and included a thorough enough sampling of Paracolletinae that genus-level classification could be evaluated. In this article a revised genus-level classification is presented for the Australian Paracolletinae, an attempt to make it more congruent with the phylogenetic relationships, as well as consistent with the classification of the South American paracolletine generic classification. According to the classification proposal presented here, Paracolletinae comprise 425 species, 298 of them endemic to the Australian Region. All subgenera of Leioproctus and of Paracolletes are elevated to the level of genus, thus raising the number genera occurring in the Australian Region to 25. According to a recent phylogenetic analysis of Colletidae, the Australian genus Callomelitta does not form a monophyletic group with the remaining genera of Paracolletinae. Callomelitta is hence removed from Paracolletinae and placed on a subfamily of its own, Callomelittinae, subfamily nov. Additionally, a new species of the Australian Paracolletinae genus Andrenopsis Cockerell is described as Andrenopsis michenerianus, sp. n..},

The SDS-PAGE major band corresponding to the remaining protein was observed only in the hornet silks of V. mandarinia and V ducalis.

	abstract = {In termites, the soldiers' sex ratio is often biased toward one sex. Unlike in the Hymenoptera, this bias cannot easily be explained by relatedness asymmetries because termites are diploid. Matsuura proposed that when large body size is adaptive for colony defence (e.g. in case of phragmotic defence) then the larger sex (given sexual size dimorphism exists) should be more likely to reach a threshold size and develop into soldiers. This would explain biased sex ratios. Matsuura validated his hypothesis for four Reticulitermes species. Here, we tested his hypothesis for two species of Cryptotermes with phragmotic defence. These drywood termites have a life type that is thought to be ancestral in termite's evolution, thus giving us potential insights into the evolution of the soldier caste. In one of these species, the sex ratio of soldiers was highly female biased, but we could not support Matsuura's hypothesis. Both species lacked sexual size dimorphism in all castes. Additionally, in both species, the sex ratio of helpers and sexuals did not deviate from a 1:1 ratio, and hence can also not account for the bias observed in soldiers. However, this study showed that there were behavioural differences between the sexes in both species, which could shed some light on biased sex ratio in soldiers. Our findings also indicate that the developmental pathway taken by individuals reflects a `decision' at the colony level. The discovery of behavioural differences between sexes in termites should open the way to similar studies in other taxa with helpers/ workers of both sexes, as it might reveal more task partitioning in colonies than previously thought and it raises questions concerning the selective pressures that acted on caste evolution in termites.},

The compelling behaviours of vespoids have been instrumental in developing theories of stepwise evolutionary transitions, which necessarily depend on an understanding of phylogeny, yet, existing morphological phylogenies for Vespoidea conflict. We collected molecular data from four nuclear genes (elongation factor-1 alpha F2 copy, long-wavelength rhodopsin, wingless and the D2-D3 regions of 28S ribosomal RNA (2700 bp in total)) to produce the first molecular phylogeny of Vespoidea. We analysed molecular data alone and in combination with published morphological data from Brothers and Carpenter. Parsimony analyses left many deeper nodes unsupported, but suggested paraphyly of three families. Total-evidence Bayesian inference produced a more resolved tree, in which the monophyly of Vespoidea was nevertheless ambiguous. Bayesian inference of molecular data alone returned a well-resolved consensus with posterior probabilities of over 95\% for most nodes. We used this topology as the best estimate of phylogeny at the family and subfamily levels. Notable departures from previous estimates include: (i) paraphyly of Vespoidea resulting from the nesting of Apoidea within a lineage comprising Formicidae, Scoliidae and two subfamilies of Bradynobaenidae; (ii) paraphyly of Bradynobaenidae, Mutillidae and Tiphiidae; (iii) a sister relationship between Rhopalosomatidae and Vespidae; and (iv) Rhopalosomatidae + Vespidae as sister to all other vespoids/apoids.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-8-237},
	abstract = {Background: Ants of the genus Lasius are ecologically important and an important system for evolutionary research. Progress in evolutionary research has been hindered by the lack of a well-founded phylogeny of the subgenera, with three previous attempts disagreeing. Here we employed two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S ribosomal RNA), comprising 1,265 bp, together with 64 morphological characters, to recover the phylogeny of Lasius by Bayesian and Maximum Parsimony inference after exploration of potential causes of phylogenetic distortion. We use the resulting framework to infer evolutionary pathways for social parasitism and fungiculture. Results: We recovered two well supported major lineages. One includes Acanthomyops, Austrolasius, Chthonolasius, and Lasius pallitarsis, which we confirm to represent a seventh subgenus, the other clade contains Dendrolasius, and Lasius sensu stricto. The subgenus Cautolasius, displaying neither social parasitism nor fungiculture, probably belongs to the second clade, but its phylogenetic position is not resolved at the cutoff values of node support we apply. Possible causes for previous problems with reconstructing the Lasius phylogeny include use of other reconstruction techniques, possibly more prone to instabilities in some instances, and the inclusion of phylogenetically distorting characters. Conclusion: By establishing an updated phylogenetic framework, our study provides the basis for a later formal taxonomic revision of subgenera and for studying the evolution of various ecologically and sociobiologically relevant traits of Lasius, although there is need for future studies to include nuclear genes and additional samples from the Nearctic. Both social parasitism and fungiculture evolved twice in Lasius, once in each major lineage, which opens up new opportunities for comparative analyses. The repeated evolution of social parasitism has been established for other groups of ants, though not for temporary social parasitism as found in Lasius. For fungiculture, the independent emergence twice in a monophyletic group marks a novel scenario in ants. We present alternative hypotheses for the evolution of both traits, with one of each involving loss of the trait. Though less likely for both traits than later evolution without reversal, we consider reversal as sufficiently plausible to merit independent testing.},

The Ogasawara Islands are geographically closest to the Japanese Archipelago, but this area is inhabited only by species of a different subgenus, Alloxylocopa. Thus, X. ogasawarensis is commonly thought to have originated from other members of Koptortosoma, which is widely distributed in the Oriental tropical region. In this study, we investigated the origin of X. ogasawarensis using a phylogenetic analysis of Xylocopa based on four genes: mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b), and nuclear elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). A combined analysis of the four genes strongly suggests that Koptortosoma is a large, polyphyletic group, within which Alloxylocopa is embedded. Xylocopa ogasawarensis emerged as the species most closely related to Alloxylocopa and not to Oriental species of Koptortosoma. Contrary to previous views of the origin of X. ogasawarensis, our results suggest that X. ogasawarensis and Alloxylocopa share a common origin and diverged after they colonized the island regions of East Asia.},

	abstract = {A landmark-based geometric morphometric approach was used to assess differences in the size and shape of wing among/within three species of the Cheilosia canicularis group (Diptera: Syrphidae): C. canicularis, C. himantopus and C. orthotricha. Wing size and shape variation was observed from 25, 176 and 41 specimens of C. canicularis, C. himantopus and C. orthotricha, respectively, collected from six localities on the Balkan Peninsula. Significant differences in wing size were obtained among the analysed species and canonical variate analysis showed that wing shape was sufficiently different to allow the correct classification of 73\% individuals of C. canicularis, 80\% of C. orthotricha and 94\% of C. himantopus, and clear delimitation of the species pairs C. canicularis/C. orthotricha and C. himantopus/C. orthotricha. In all analysed species, the consistent sex dimorphism in wing shape was observed indicating that female specimens had shorter and broader wings than males. The UPGMA cluster analysis based on squared Mahalanobis distances revealed close accordance with previously published phylogenetic relationships of these species indicated by allozyme and DNA sequence data analysis. Our results suggested that wing parameters contain useful information in quantification phenotypic variation and identification of species in this challenging group for taxonomy and systematics.},

Most species are known only front females as the males typically show too few differences to be useful in characterizing species. The monophyly of Melaloncha and its two subgenera (Udamochiras and Melaloncha s.s.) is strongly supported by morphological characters, but the phylogenetic relationships among the various species and species groups are not well understood. Here, we report on a preliminary molecular phylogenetic study of 30 exemplar Melaloncha species representing both subgenera and seven species groups by using a combination of nuclear (28S and CAD) and mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND1 and CO1) genes for a total of 3,306 bp. Maximum parsimony analysis suggested the following relationships: 1) Melaloncha is monophyletic, 2) the subgenus M. (Udamochiras) is monophyletic and is a sister-group to AT (Melaloncha), and 3) each of the species groups for which we had multiple species were monophyletic with the M. furcata-group being the sister-group to all other Group II taxa. These results support hypotheses of relationships based on morphological characters. The utility of the molecular data for associating morphologically dissimilar males and females is discussed.},

	abstract = {Pheidole is currently the most species rich genus of ants in the world, with many taxa still awaiting description. In this study, I reconstruct the phylogeny of Pheidole using molecular characters from three mitochondrial genes and two nuclear genes for similar to 140 species. The phylogenetic relationships of Pheidole are investigated with special interest in understanding factors that may have led to their remarkable diversity. The results presented here establish a framework for understanding the explosive radiation of this group by providing (1) a phylogenetic estimate, and (2) a comparative analysis of life history traits that are likely to have been important in the diversification of the group. In all analyses, Pheidole is recovered as a monophyletic lineage, and molecular clock estimates infer an age of 58.4-61.2 million years ago (Ma) for crown group members of the genus. Using an estimate of diversification rate, it appears that Pheidole has undergone 0.108-0.103 speciation events per million years. Previous hypotheses of species groups were largely not upheld in the analyses presented here. Workers of the genus Pheidole are dimorphic with a minor and major (soldier) subcaste. A third subcaste of super majors is known in eight species of Pheidole and this trait was found to have arisen multiple times throughout the phylogeny. Seed harvesting is common among species of the genus and is thought to be one of the factors leading to the diversification of the group, but additional data will be required to further test this hypothesis. To address biogeographic questions on the origin of the genus, both New and Old World species were included in these analyses, and the results suggest that Pheidole is New World in origin with a possible single introduction into the Old World.

	abstract = {Neodiprion Rohwer (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae) is a Holarctic genus of conifer-feeding sawflies with a remarkable amount of inter- and intraspecific diversity in host use, behavior, and development. This variation is thought to play a central role in Neodiprion diversification, but speciation hypotheses remain untested due to a lack of a robust phylogenetic estimate. Here, we utilize sequence data from three nuclear genes (CAD, ANL43, EF1 alpha) to obtain a phylogenetic estimate for the genus. These analyses suggest that: (1) North American and Eurasian Neodiprion are monophyletic sister clades, (2) the sertifer group is paraphyletic with respect to the monophyletic lecontei group, and (3) on at least two occasions, dispersal from eastern to western North America proceeded via southern host bridges. Based on these results and host biogeography, we revise a previous scenario for the evolution of Neodiprion and suggest maximum ages for the genus and for the lecontei group (25 My and 14 My, respectively). In addition, because a previous study reported rampant mitochondrial introgression in the lecontei group, we assess its prevalence in the sertifer group. Analysis of three mitochondrial genes (COI, tRNA-leucine, and COII) reveals that mito-nuclear discordance is prevalent in the sertifer group, and patterns of species monophyly are consistent with those expected under frequent mitochondrial introgression. As was the case for lecontei group species, we find that introgression appears to be most pronounced between species that occasionally share hosts, suggesting that divergent host use is an important barrier to gene flow in Neodiprion. Finally, we suggest that the lack of phylogenetic resolution and prevalence of species non-monophyly in the non-Pinus feeding Neodiprion may result from the rapid divergence (possibly with gene flow) of these species following their entry into a novel adaptive zone.

In the present work, we cloned the full sequence of gene CvBV-ank2, encoding an I kappa B-like protein in C. vestalis polydnavirus (CvBV). The full sequence of CvBV-ank2 is 955 bp, encoding 162 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 18,355 Do. CvBV-ank2 shares high similarity with the exon I and exon II of CvBV-ank1, which is on the some segment with CvBV-ank2. This result suggests that gene duplication might occur in CvBV-ank1 and CvBV-ank2. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CvBV-ank2 and CvBV-ank1, both on segment CvBV-S2, are, respectively, closely related with CcBV\_26.3 and CcBV\_26.2, both on segment Circle26 of C. congregata polydnavirus (CcBV). BLAST search using the sequence of segment CvBV-S2 as a query revealed that segment CvBV-S2 shares 90\% max identity with segment Circle26 of CcBV over 67\% query coverage. These results demonstrate that there is not only gene similarity, but also segment similarity between CvBV and CcBV. Transcripts of CvBV-ank2 were detected as early as 0.5 h post-parositization and continued to be detected for 6 days, indicating that CvBV-ank2 might be involved in the early protection of the parasitoid egg.},

	abstract = {Bees are among the most important pollinators of angiosperm plants. Many bee species show narrow host-plant preferences, reflected both in behavioral and morphological adaptations to particular attributes of host-plant pollen or floral morphology. Whether bee host-plant associations reflect co-cladogenesis of bees and their host plants or host-switches to unrelated host plants is not clear. Rophitinae is a basal subfamily of Halictidae in which most species show narrow host-plant preferences (oligolecty). We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the rophitine genera using a combination of adult morphology (24 characters) and DNA sequence data (EF-1 alpha, LW rhodopsin, wingless; 2700 bp total). The data set was analyzed by parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. All methods yielded highly congruent results. Using the phylogeny, we investigated the pattern of host-plant association as well as the historical biogeography of Rophitinae. Our biogeographical analysis suggests a number of dispersal/vicariance events: (1) a basal split between North America and South America (most likely a dispersal from South America to North America), and (2) at least two subsequent interchanges between North America and Eurasia (presumably via the northern hemisphere land bridges). Our analysis of host-plant associations indicates that Rophitinae specialized on a closely related group of angiosperm orders in the Euasterid I clade (mainly Gentianales, Lamiales and Solanales). However, there is little evidence of cocladogenesis between bees and plants and strong evidence of host switches to unrelated host plants. Based on our phylogenetic results we describe two new tribes of Rophitinae: Conanthalictini new tribe (including the genus Conanthalictus) and Xeralictini new tribe (including Xeralictus and Protodufourea).

The mean estimated genomic size of this virus based on PstI, BstEII, StyI, HindIII restriction profiles was estimated to be 106 +/- 2.5 kbp (mean +/- SE). A clone designated as TnMNPV/CmBCL9 was used in bioassays against several lepidopteran pests and in comparative studies with the baculoviruses AcMNPV, AgMNPV, AfMNPV, PxMNPV and HzSNPV of Autographa californica, Anticarsia gemmatalis, Anagrapha falcifera, Plutella xylostella, and Helicoverpa zea, respectively. Infectivity studies showed that TnMNPV/CmBCL9 was highly infectious for Heliothis subflexa and T. ni, with an LC50 value 0.07 occlusion bodies/mm(2) in both species and also infectious for H. zea and Heliothis virescens with LC50 values of 0.22 and 0.27 occlusion bodies/mm(2), respectively. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the isolate and selected baculoviruses revealed profiles that were very similar to AfMNPV but different from the restriction endonuclease profiles of the other baculoviruses. Hybridization studies suggest that the TnMNPV/CmBCL9 was closely related to AfMNPV and AcMNPV-HPP. Further support for this comes from a phylogenetic analysis employing a split-graphs network, comparing the polh, egt, and p10 genes from TnMNPV/CmBCL9 with those from other baculoviruses and suggests that this virus is closely related to the AcMNPV variants, AfMNPV and RoMNPV of Rachiplusia ou.},

	abstract = {Background: Obligate asexual reproduction is rare in the animal kingdom. Generally, asexuals are considered evolutionary dead ends that are unable to radiate. The phytophagous mite genus Bryobia contains a large number of asexual species. In this study, we investigate the origin and evolution of asexuality using samples from 111 populations in Europe, South Africa and the United States, belonging to eleven Bryobia species. We also examine intraspecific clonal diversity for one species, B. kissophila, by genotyping individuals from 61 different populations. Knowledge on the origin of asexuality and on clonal diversity can contribute to our understanding of the paradox of sex. Results: The majority ( 94\%) of 111 sampled populations reproduces asexually. Analysis of part of nuclear 28S rDNA shows that these asexuals do not form a monophyletic clade. Analysis of the mitochondrial COI region shows that intraspecific variation is extensive ( up to 8.8\%). Within B. kissophila, distinct clades are found, which are absent at the nuclear 28S rDNA level. Moreover, paraphyletic patterns are found at the mitochondrial DNA. Conclusion: Asexuality is widespread in the genus Bryobia, signifying that some animal taxa do contain a high number of asexuals. We argue that asexuality originated multiple times within Bryobia. Wolbachia bacteria cause asexuality in at least two Bryobia species and may have infected different species independently. The high intraspecific clonal diversity and the patterns of paraphyly at the mitochondrial DNA in B. kissophila might be explained by a high mutation fixation rate and past hybridization events. Reproductive parasites like Wolbachia and Cardinium might influence these processes. We discuss the role these bacteria could play in the evolutionary success of asexual species.},

Data partitions were analyzed separately and in combination, by employing ML (maximum likelihood), MP (maximum parsimony), and Bayesian methods.

	abstract = {The bee tribe Ctenoplectrini, with two genera, comprises nine species in tropical Africa and ten in Asia and Australia. Most of them collect floral oil, pollen, and nectar from Cucurbitaceae, but three species are thought to be cleptoparasites. The unusual morphology of Ctenoplectrini has made it difficult to infer their closest relatives, in turn preventing an understanding of these bees' geographic and temporal origin. We used two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers (4741 nucleotides) generated for most of the species to test the monophyly of the tribe, its relationships to other Apidae, and its biogeographic history. Ctenoplectrini are strongly supported as monophyletic and closest to the Long-horned bees, Eucerini. The presumably cleptoparasitic species form a clade (Ctenoplectrina) that is sister to the remaining species (Ctenoplectra), confirming the independent evolution of cleptoparasitism in this tribe. Tree topology and molecular dating together suggest that Ctenoplectrini originated in Africa in the Early Eocene and that Ctenoplectra dispersed twice from Africa to Asia, sometime in the Late Eocene, 30-40 my ago, from where one species reached the Australian continent via Indonesia and New Guinea in the mid-Miocene, c. 13 my ago. Dry and cool mid-Miocene climates also coincide with the divergence between Ctenoplectra bequaerti from West Africa and Ctenoplectra terminalis from East and South Africa, perhaps related to fragmentation of the equatorial African rainforest belt.

An egg of N. patruelis is also described. An analysis, based on both halictid specimens and descriptions from the literature, reveals that the three subfamilies (Rophitinae, Nomiinae, and Halictinae) of Halictidae can be distinguished on the basis of their mature larvae. A key is provided for their identification. Mature larvae of the tribes of the Halictinae are so similar they cannot be distinguished at present, although studies of additional representatives may yield diagnostic features particularly concerning mandibular anatomy and perhaps body size. Features of the mature larvae when mapped onto a phylogeny of the Halictidae (Pesenko, 2000) provide a hypothesis for the sequence of anatomical changes in the evolution of mature larvae. Observations during excavation of the nesting site provided detailed, if fragmentary, information concerning nest architecture, provisioning, voltinism, and nest parasites of Nomioides paturelis. These are discussed in relation to information concerning other species of Nomioidini from the literature. Chiasmognathus pashupati, like its host, is probably multivoltine. The anatomy of the mature larva is similar to that of other Nomadinae, especially that of Ammobatini; however, the pupa is distinct from those of other known Ammobatini.

	abstract = {Taxonomy and phylogeny of members of the genus Trichogramma is often critical because of the fact that proper species discrimination can only be achieved by male morphology. Cryptic species, particularly when only females are available (in case of parthenogenetic species or strains), are common in this genus with consequences for practical purposes like biocontrol unless males can be obtained after antibiotic treatment. The internally transcribed spacer 2 region of the ribosomal DNA was used to assess the identity of Trichogramma aurosum Sugonjaev and Sorokina individuals collected on eggs of Nematus tibialis Newman (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) from different locations in Middle Europe. Amplified products were identical in length (ca. 450bp), sequences showed a high percent similarity ({\textgreater}96\%), and no cryptic species could be detected in the samples. In contrast, a comparison with T. aurosum populations from the USA showed values between 86\% and 90\%. Additional studies are needed to clarify the relationship between US and European populations. Furthermore, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was conducted with T. aurosum wasps collected at 25 different European locations. one hundred and twenty-three AFLP fragments could be detected using three different AFLP primer combinations of which 98\% were polymorphic in more than one individual. An analysis of genetic distances based on the obtained AFLP markers indicated the existence of some genetic variability between the European T. aurosum individuals and allowed a grouping according to their geographic origin. This study represents the first successful application of the AFLP marker technique to such tiny insects as Trichogramma species.},

	abstract = {The microgastroid complex of braconid wasps is a widely recognized and biologically coherent lineage of endoparasitoids of lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars). The complex has received significant phylogenetic attention in recent years due in part to the taxons' association with mutualistic polydnaviruses, with which they compromise host immune systems. A number of previous attempts using a variety of morphological and molecular approaches have not unequivocally resolved relationships amongst the main subfamilies. This work represents a more extensive attempt to resolve the microgastroid relationships, using seven genes (16S rRNA, cytochrome oxidase I (CO 1), 28S rRNA, arginine kinase (ArgK), long wavelength rhodopsin (Ops), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1a) and wingless (Wg)) and a greater taxonomic representation. Bayesian, likelihood and parsimony phylogenetic reconstructions of this improved data set has determined that the chelonines diverged first from the remainder of the microgastroids, however the relationships amongst the other subfamilies are still unclear, suggesting a greater nucleotide sample is required to resolve them. Examination of the contribution of individual gene trees to the phylogeny demonstrates why the relationships between subfamilies are still unclear, with not all groups monophyletic for all trees. Filtered supernetworks demonstrate that monophyly of all subfamilies is only recovered when splits found in only one or two genes are excluded, but this also results in little remaining structure left in the deep nodes to resolve inter-subfamily relationships. By increasing the breadth of the study we were also able to re-evaluate previous attempts at dating the lineage and, therefore the origin of the polydnavirus association. Previous attempts used a much reduced data set and fewer fossil calibrations. Thorough literature searches have revealed a substantial increase in the fossil calibrations and these, combined with more sophisticated molecular dating analysis, have substantially increased the age of the microgastroid lineage from previous estimates of similar to 73 MYA to similar to 100 MYA. Examination of the resultant linearized clock tree also allows an insight into the evolution of the more species rich subfamilies. The chelonines appear to have had a steady rate of evolution, whilst the microgastrines and cardiochilines appear to have undergone a more significant “burst” of evolution. It is hypothesized that the different parasitism strategies of subfamilies (Chelonines are egg parasitoids and the remainder are larval parasitioids) may have influenced the evolutionary rates of the groups.

The cladistic analyses of the 21 terminal species (15 ingroup and six outgroup species) and 48 characters, from external morphology and male genitalia, produced one cladogram under equal weights and two under implied weights. The monophyly of Pseudodynerus was corroborated in all three hypotheses, although the internal relationships varied depending on the weighting scheme. Two major clades were recovered under both equal and implied weights, one containing mostly Central and North American species and the other only South American species. The main difference between the hypotheses involves the placement of P. luctuosus, which comes out either as sister to a clade formed by P. hallinani + (P. maxillaris + P. quadrisectus + P. crypticus) or as sister to a clade comprising the remaining species. Fifteen species of Pseudodynerus are recognized, of which four are described as new: P. crypticus from Costa Rica, P. carpenteri from French Guiana and Suriname, P. obesus from Rondonia, Brazil, and P. singularis from Espirito Santo, Brazil.

	volume = {8},
	issn = {1536-2442},
	abstract = {The parasitic wasp, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), introduces an entomopoxvirus (DlEPV) into its Caribbean fruit fly host, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew) (Diptera: Tephritidae), during oviposition. DlEPV has a 250-300 kb unipartite dsDNA genome, that replicates in the cytoplasm of the host's hemocytes, and inhibits the host's encapsulation response. The putative proteins encoded by several DlEPV genes are highly homologous with those of poxviruses, while others appear to be DlEPV specific. Here, a 2.34 kb sequence containing a 1.64 kb DlEPV open reading frame within a cloned 4.5 kb EcoR1 fragment (designated R1-1) is described from a DlEPV EcoRI genomic library. This open reading frame is a homolog of the vaccinia virus rifampicin resistance (rif) gene, D13L, and encodes a putative 546 amino acid protein. The DlEPV rif contains two EcoRV, two HindIII, one XbaI, and one DraII restriction sites, and upstream of the open reading frame the fragment also contains EcoRV, HindII, SpEI, and BsP106 sites. Early poxvirus transcription termination signals (TTTTTnT) occur 236 and 315 nucleotides upstream of the consensus poxvirus late translational start codon (TAAATG) and at 169 nucleotides downstream of the translational stop codon of the rif open reading frame. Southern blot hybridization of HindIII-, EcoRI-, and BamH1-restricted DlEPV genomic DNA probed with the labeled 4.5 kb insert confirmed the fidelity of the DNA and the expected number of fragments appropriate to the restriction endonucleases used. Pairwise comparisons between DlEPV amino acids and those of the Amsacta moorei, Heliothis armigera, and Melanoplus sanguinipes entomopoxviruses, revealed 46, 46, and 45 \% similarity (identity + substitutions), respectively. Similar values (41-45\%) were observed in comparisons with the chordopoxviruses. The mid portion of the DlEPV sequence contained two regions of highest conserved residues similar to those reported for H. armigera entomopoxvirus rifampicin resistance protein. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences suggested that DlEPV arose from the same ancestral node as other entomopoxviruses but belongs to a separate clade from those of the grasshopper-infecting M. sanguinipes entomopoxvirus and from the Lepidoptera-infecting (Genus B or Betaentomopoxvirus) A. moorei entomopoxvirus and H. armigera entomopoxvirus. Interestingly, the DlEPV putative protein had only 3-26.4 \% similarity with RIF-like homologs/orthologs found in other large DNA non-poxviruses, demonstrating its closer relationship to the Poxviridae. DlEPV remains an unassigned member of the Entomopoxvirinae (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/index.htm) until its relationship to other diptera-infecting (Gammaentomopoxvirus or Genus C) entomopoxviruses can be verified.

Two molecular methods, inter-simple sequence repeat-polymerase chain reaction DNA fingerprinting and a phylogeographic approach inferred from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI), were utilized. Five geographic populations from South America were analyzed; in addition, a phylogenetic analysis was performed with several named and one unnamed Gonatocerus species using the COI gene. DNA fingerprinting demonstrated a fixed geographic banding pattern difference in the population from San Rafael, Mendoza Province, Argentina. The COI analysis uncovered haplotype or geographic structure in G. tuberculifemur. A neighbour-joining distance (NJ) and a single most parsimonious tree (MP) clustered the populations into two well-supported distinct clades with strong bootstrap values (97-99\% and 92-99\%, respectively) with populations from San Rafael clustering into clade 2 and the rest of the populations clustering into clade 1. No haplotype sharing was observed between individuals from the two clades. Phylogenetic analyses performed by NJ and MP methods with 15 Gonatocerus species confirmed species boundaries and again uncovered two distinct clades in G. tuberculifemur with strong bootstrap support (95-100\% and 68-100\%, respectively). However, the NJ tree supported the morphologically defined relationships better than the MP tree. The molecular evidence in the present Study is suggestive of a species level divergence. Because C. tuberculifemur, is under consideration as a potential biological control agent for GWSS in California, understanding cryptic variation in this species is critical.},

We reconstructed a molecular phylogeny of eight Japanese species using the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and compared the sex ratio, developmental period, and egg number (fecundity) of each species within a species group by rearing them in the laboratory. Habitat preference was also analyzed from both collection and literature data. The reconstructed molecular phylogeny suggested that parthenogenesis evolved independently multiple times in this lineage. There were three clusters in the tree, in each of which the idiosoma, leg, setae, and spermathecal morphology of females was similar or identical; this suggested that mites in the same cluster were sister species. There was no relationship between sexual mode and life history traits or habitat preference. These results suggest that sexual and asexual species use different microhabitats. Because S. similis (sexual), S. elongata (thelytokous), and S. estradai (thelytokous) were in the same cluster and spermathecae of the first two were similar while that of the last was distinctively reduced, we hypothesized that speciation occurred in this order and that spermathecae are reduced and eventually lost during the course of parthenogenetic evolution.},

The frequency of A haplotypes decreases in a SW-NE trend, while that of M haplotypes increases. These results are discussed in relation to hypotheses about the African origin of Apis mellifera and an early colonization of west Europe during intermediate Pleistocene glaciation events, followed by a regional differentiation. The extant pattern of haplotype frequency and distribution seems to be influenced at a regional scale by adaptation to local climatic conditions and the mobile beekeeping that has become a large-scale practice during the last decades.

Another reason for difficulty in resolving some of the relationships using molecular data is the limited spectrum of genes so far developed for phylogeny estimation. For this latter issue, there is cause for current optimism owing to rapid increases in our knowledge of comparative genomics. At least some historical patterns of divergence may, however, continue to defy our attempts to completely reconstruct them with confidence, at least using current strategies.},

A dispersal-vicariance analysis showed a strong geographical signal for the taxa included, with molecular dating estimates for the origin of Doryctinae and its subsequent radiation both occurring during the late Paleocene-early Eocene.

	abstract = {Sequences from the nuclear long-wavelength-rhodopsin and the mitochondrial cytochrome-oxidase (subunit I) from different representatives of the Apoidea, with special emphasis on digger wasps (Sphecidae sense tat), were analysed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Baysian inference methods. Compared with previous phylogenetic studies based on morphology, the results of the molecular analyses are controversial but correspond in the absence of support for the Sphecidae s. l (sensu BOHART \& MENKE). The relationships within the Sphecidae sensu stricto correspond largely with recent morphological studies. There is circumstantial evidence that the Ampulicidae and Sphecidae s. str. together form a monophyletic group, whereas the relationships within this taxon are still uncertain. Although there is no evidence for a definitive phylogenetic position of the Heterogynaidae; it can be excluded that they are the sistertaxon to all other Apoidea. Instead, they are probably a derived group within the Crabronidae. In conflict to the majority of current morphological studies, the molecular analyses provide no support for the Crabronidae and Bembicinae. Some molecular analyses imply a close relationship between Philanthinae and bees.},

	abstract = {Bumble bees (Bombus) are a cold-adapted, largely alpine group that can elucidate patterns of Holarctic historical biogeography, particularly in comparison to the alpine plants with which they likely coevolved. A recently published molecular phylogeny of bumble bees provides uniquely comprehensive species sampling for exploring historical patterns of distribution and diversification. Using this phylogeny and detailed data on extant distributions, I reconstruct the historical distribution of bumble bees in a temporal framework, estimating divergence times using fossil data and molecular rates derived from the literature. The nearly comprehensive phylogeny allows assessment of the tempo of diversification within the bumble bees using lineage-through-time plots and diversification statistics, which have been performed with special consideration to confidence intervals. These analyses reveal movements of Bombus concordant with geographic and climatic events of the late Cenozoic. The initial diversification of extant bumble bee lineages was estimated at around 25 to 40 Ma, near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary 34 Ma, a period of dramatic global cooling. Dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) predicted an Old World Bombus ancestor, with early diversification events largely restricted to the eastern Old World. The numerous intercontinental dispersal events occurred mostly in the direction of Old World to New World and North America to South America. Early movements from the Palearctic into the Nearctic most likely took place after 20 Ma and may have coincided with a period of Miocene cooling that gave rise to taiga habitat across Beringia. Subsequent dispersal between these regions is estimated to have occurred among boreal and tundra-adapted species mostly in the last 5 million years. Radiations are estimated in both Nearctic and Neotropical regions at similar to 6 to 8 Ma and after 3.5 Ma, concordant with the opening of land corridors between the continents.},

	abstract = {Conifer-feeding sawflies in the genus Neodiprion provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the origin and maintenance of barriers to reproduction, but obtaining a phylogenetic estimate for comparative studies of Neodiprion speciation has proved difficult. Specifically, nonmonophyly within and discordance between individual gene trees, both of which are common in groups that diverged recently and/or rapidly, make it impossible to infer a species tree using methods that are designed to estimate gene trees. Therefore, in this study, we estimate relationships between members of the lecontei species group using four approaches that are intended to estimate species, not gene, trees: (1) minimize deep coalescences (MDC), (2) shallowest divergences (SD), (3) Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST), and (4) a novel approach that combines concatenation with monophyly constraints (CMC). Multiple populations are sampled for most species and all four methods incorporate this intraspecific variation into estimates of interspecific relationships. We investigate the sensitivity of each method to taxonomic sampling, and, for the BEST method, we assess the impact of prior choice on species-tree inference. We also compare species-tree estimates to one another and to a morphologically based hypothesis to identify clades that are supported by multiple analyses and lines of evidence. We find that both taxonomic sampling and method choice impact species-tree estimates and that, for these data, the BEST method is strongly influenced by and branch-length priors. We also find that the CMC method is the least sensitive to taxonomic sampling. Finally, although interspecific genetic variation is low due to the recent divergence of the lecontei group, our results to date suggest that incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific gene flow are the main factors complicating species-tree inference in Neodiprion. Based on these analyses, we propose a phylogenetic hypothesis for the lecontei group. Finally, our results suggest that, even for very challenging groups like Neodiprion, an underlying species-tree signal can be extracted from multi-locus data as long as intraspecific variation is adequately sampled and methods that focus on the estimation of species trees are used.},

	abstract = {The scale insect tribe Iceryini (Coccoidea: Monophlebidae) is a group of relatively large and polyphagous insects found worldwide. Currently, the tribe contains about 80 named species placed in seven genera, which are diagnosed largely on features associated with egg protection. We reconstruct the phylogeny of the Iceryini on the basis of nucleotide sequence data from nuclear ribosomal (18S and D2, D3 and D10 regions of 28S) and protein-coding (historic H3) gene regions of 40 iceryine species representing six of the seven genera and seven outgroup taxa, mostly from two other tribes of Monophlebidae. Bayesian and maximum parsimony analyses recover a monophyletic tribe and clades that correspond more to geography than to the existing morphology-based classification. Gueriniella Fernald is sister to the rest of the Iceryini and the genera Crypticerya Cockerell, Icerya Signoret and Steatococcus Ferris are not monophyletic. Our data imply that the distinctive iceryine reproductive strategies, such as protecting eggs in a waxy ovisac or inside a marsupium, are poor indicators of relationships. On the basis of molecular relationships and the re-examination of morphological characters, we recognize only five genera of Iceryini - Crypticerya, Echinicerya Morrison, Gigantococcus Pesson \& Bielenin, Gueriniella and Icerya - and substantially revise the generic concepts of Crypticerya, Gigantococcus and Icerya. We provide a key to the genera based on adult females. We redescribe and illustrate the adult female and first-instar nymph of the type species Crypticerya rosae (Riley \& Howard), Echinicerya anomala Morrison, Gigantococcus maximus (Newstead) (adult female only), Gueriniella serratulae (Fabricius) and Icerya seychellarum (Westwood). We recognize Auloicerya Morrison as a junior synonym (syn.n.) of Icerya, and transfer the two Auloicerya species to Icerya as L acaciae (Morrison \& Morrison) comb.n. and L australis Maskell comb.rev. We recognize Steatococcus and Proticerya Cockerell as junior synonyms (syn.n.) of Crypticerya. From Steatococcus, we transfer five species to Crypticerya [C. mexicana Cockerell \& Parrott comb.rev., C. morrilli (Cockerell) comb.n., C. tabernicola (Ferris) comb.n., C. townsendi Cockerell comb.rev., C. tuberculata (Morrison) comb.n.], four species to Gigantococcus [Gi. euphorbiae (Brain) comb.n., Gi. gowdeyi (Newstead) comb.n., Gi. madagascariensis (Mamet) comb.n., Gi. theobromae (Newstead) comb.n.] and three species to Icerya [I. assamensis (Rao) comb.n., I nudata Maskell comb.rev., I. samaraia (Morrison) comb.n.].

From Crypticerya, we transfer seven species to Icerya [I. clauseni (Rao) comb.n., I. jacobsoni Green eomb.rev., I. jaihind (Rao) comb.n., I. kumri (Rao) comb.n., I. mangiferae (Tang \& Hao) comb.n., I. natalensis (Douglas) comb.rev., L nuda Green comb.rev.] and five species to Gigantococcus [Gi. bicolor (Newstead) comb.n., Gi. cqjani (Newstead) comb.n., Gi. caudatus (Newstead) comb.n., Gi. ewarti (Newstead) comb.n., Gi. rodriguesi (Castel-Branco) comb.n.]. Both I. hyperici (Froggatt) and Palaeococcus dymocki (Froggatt) are syn.n. of I. nudata (all previously placed in Steatococcus). We recognize I. maynei Vayssiere as a syn.n. of Gi. nigroareolatus, I. tremae Vayssiere as a syn.n. of Gi. schoutedeni and L townsendi plucheae Cockerell as a syn.n. of C. townsendi.

Four species, Coccus hirticornis Boyer de Fonscolombe, I. chilensis Hempel, L insulans Hempel and I. paulista Hempel, are considered incertae sedis. We designate lectotypes for C. rosae, E. anomala and I. candida (a junior synonym of I. seychellarum). Following this revision, we recognize 74 species of Iceryini, distributed as follows: 22 in Crypticerya, one in Echinicerya, 19 in Gigantococcus, two in Gueriniella and 30 in Icerya.},

Both of these subgenera became monophyletic following successive approximations character weighting. Four distinctive new subgenera are described: Unicarinicola Packer subgen.n., Obesicola Packer subgen.n., Capitatiscopa Packer subgen.n. and Toroediscelis Packer subgen.n., and a revised key to the subgenera of Chilicola is provided.},

	abstract = {A morphological phylogenetic analysis of the world genera of Diparinae ( Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) is provided, and the generic classification is revised. A hypothesized phylogeny is given based on 73 characters, primarily from adult females. The diparines are supported as monophyletic in all analyses based on 4-6 synapomorphies depending on their sister-group, including the presence of a cercal brush which is synapomorphic in all analyses. The cercal brush, in combination with the absence of a smooth, convex dorsellum, is diagnostic for Diparinae. Liepara Boucek ( Pteromalidae: subfamily inquirenda) and Bohpa Darling ( Pteromalidae: Ceinae) both appear as sister-group to Diparinae in different analyses. In the proposed classification scheme, Diparinae consists of 116 species in 14 genera. Nine genera are removed from Diparinae, two of which are placed in synonymy: Calolelaps Timberlake, Dinarmolaelaps Masi, Mesolelaps Ashmead, Neolelaps Ashmead, and Stictolelaps Timberlake are placed in Pteromalinae ( Pteromalidae), while Seyrigina Risbec is placed in Eulophinae ( Eulophidae); Diparisca Hedqvist is synonymized under Spalangiopelta Masi ( Pteromalidae: Ceinae); Bekiliella Risbec is synonymized under Notanisus Walker ( Pteromalidae: Cleonyminae); and Liepara Boucek and the tribe Lieparini Boucek are placed in Pteromalidae without a subfamily association. Fifteen new generic synonyms are proposed: Afrolelaps Hedqvist, Alloterra Kieffer and Marshall, Diparomorpha Hedqvist, Emersonia Girault, Grahamisia Delucchi, Parurios Girault, Pondia Hedqvist, Pseudipara Girault, Trimicrops Kieffer, and Uriolelaps Girault under Dipara Walker; Spalangiolelaps Girault under Lelaps Walker; Australolaelaps Girault under Neapterolelaps Girault; Dolichodipara Hedqvist under Myrmicolelaps Hedqvist; and Dipareta Boucek and Malinka Boucek under Pseudoceraphron Dodd.

A key to the genera of Diparinae is provided. The species of each genus are cataloged, and species-level keys are provided for most genera in which new species are described.

	abstract = {Fungus-growing ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: tribe Attini) engage in mutually beneficial symbioses with fungi (Basidiomycota) that serve as their main food source. The leaf-cutters (genera Acromyrmex Mayr and Atta Fabricius), the most derived attine ants, employ elaborate nest-hygiene behaviours, including substrate preparation. By preparing substrate prior to its incorporation into the fungus garden, workers facilitate the physical breakdown of leaf material while reducing the abundance of potentially harmful microbes that contact their fungal mutualist. Despite its importance in ant fungiculture, substrate preparation has not been investigated in other genera of fungus-growing ants. We examined substrate-preparation procedures used by five genera of fungus-growing ants (Apterostigma Mayr, Cyphomyrmex Mayr, Trachymyrmex Forel, Acromyrmex, and Atta) representing most of the phylogenetic range of the Attini. Behavioural observations revealed that all five genera engage in substrate-preparation behaviours. Furthermore, these behaviours vary by genus, with Trachymyrmex, Acromyrmex, and Atta engaging in more elaborate preparation behaviours than the other genera. Additionally, we found that during substrate preparation, leaf-cutting ants inoculate leaf fragments with actinomycetous bacteria. These filamentous bacteria are known to produce antibiotics that suppress fungal pathogens, which suggests that inoculation with the bacterial mutualist during substrate preparation helps protect the fungus gardens of leaf-cutter ants from these parasites. Our finding that substrate-preparation behaviours occur across the phylogenetic range of attine ants suggests that these behaviours are a critical component of successful fungiculture by ants.},

	abstract = {Chalcidoidea (approximately 22,000 described species) is the most ecologically diverse superfamily of parasitic Hymenoptera and plays a major role in the biological control of insect pests. However, phylogenetic relationships both within and between chalcidoid families have been poorly understood, particularly for the large family Pteromalidae and relatives. Forty-two taxa, broadly representing Chalcidoidea but concentrated in the `pteromalid lineage,' were sequenced for 4620 bp of protein-coding sequence from four nuclear genes for which we present new primers. These are: CAD (1719 bp) DDC (708 bp), enolase (1149 bp), and PEPCK (1044 bp). The combined data set was analyzed using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Statistical significance of the apparent nonmonophyly of some taxonomic groups on our trees was evaluated using the approximately unbiased test of Shimodaira [Shimodaira, H. 2002. An approximately unbiased test of phylogenetic tree selection. Syst. Biol. 51(3), 492-508]. In accord with previous studies, we find moderate to strong support for monophyly of Chalcidoidea, a sister-group relationship of Mymaridae to the remainder of Chalcidoidea, and a relatively basal placement of Encarsia (Aphelinidae) within the latter. The `pteromalid lineage' of families is generally recovered as monophyletic, but the hypothesis of monophyly for Pteromalidae, which appear paraphyletic with respect to all other families sampled in that lineage. is decisively rejected (P {\textless} 10(-14)). Within Pteromalidae, monophyly was strongly supported for nearly all tribes represented by multiple exemplars, and for two subfamilies. All other multiply-represented subfamilies appeared para- or polyphyletic in our trees, although monophyly was significantly rejected only for Miscogasterinae, Ormocerinae, and Colotrechninae. The limited resolution obtained in the analyses presented here reinforces the idea that reconstruction of pteromalid phylogeny is a difficult problem, possibly due to rapid radiation of many chalcidoid taxa. Initial phylogenetic comparisons of life history traits suggest that the ancestral chalcidoid was small-bodied and parasitized insect eggs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We used four nuclear (28S-D2, ITS1, ITS2, ArgK) and two mitochondrial (COI, COII) gene regions to analyze relationships among populations in the Aphelinus varipes species complex (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) from throughout Eurasia (France, Georgia, Israel, China, Korea and Japan) and from three aphid hosts (Aphis glycines, Diuraphis noxia and Rhopalosiphum padi; Hemiptera: Aphididae). A combined analysis of 21 genotypes of Aphelinus resulted in six most-parsimonious trees, and successive approximations character-weighting selected two of these as best supported by the data. All six gene regions were necessary to fully resolve the relationships among taxa. Four clades within the A. varipes complex were distinguished: (1) Aphelinus kurdjumovi, (2) Aphelinus hordei, (3) Aphelinus atriplicis, Aphelinus varipes, and Aphelinus albipodus, and (4) Aphelinus certus (populations from China, Korea, and Japan). Based on rates of nucleotide substitutions, these clades diverged between 78 and 526 thousand years ago during a period of repeated glaciations in Eurasia. In laboratory crosses, A. kurdjumovi, A. hordei, and A. varipes were reproductively incompatible with one another and all other populations. A. atriplicis was incompatible with these three species, but not with A. certus. The populations of A. certus from China, Japan, and Korea were reproductively compatible with one another but not with the other populations. Thus, with one exception, entities that were phylogenetically distinct were also reproductively incompatible with one another. Our evidence on molecular differentiation and reproductive incompatibility supports recognition of at least five cryptic species in the A. varipes complex. We discuss likely reasons for the high rate of speciation in this complex. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A phylogenetic study of the Eurytominae (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) treating 178 taxa and based on 150 morphological characters is given. Several cladograms using the complete species sample, but obtained with different weightings, are presented. Local studies were also carried out to provide possible alternate topologies. The deep nodes of the trees were unstable and were never supported, but most of the superficial nodes were stable and robust. The results therefore provide support for a generic classification of the subfamily. The large genus Eurytoma - which includes about half of the described species of the subfamily - proved to be polyphyletic, and is redefined in a narrowed sense using putative synapomorphies. Bruchophagus and Prodecatoma were similarly redefined. The genera Philolema and Aximopsis are reconsidered and defined in a broader concept. A number of the species presently included in Eurytoma were transferred to these genera. Finally, 22 new generic synonymies are proposed and 33 species are transferred. The study also demonstrates that the Eurytomidae are polyphyletic. The results strongly support a sister-group relationship between the Heimbrinae and the Chalcididae. The Rileyinae consist of two groups of unrelated taxa. A redefinition of the subfamily in a more restricted sense is supported by our results. The remaining group, consisting of the traditional Rileyinae, is included in the subfamily Buresiinae. Considered in this way they comprise the genera Buresium and Macrorileya, the latter being a senior synonym of Archirileya. The Buresiinae appear as the sister group of the Eurytominae. We propose to restrict the family Eurytomidae to these two taxa. This sister-group relationship provides evidence to polarize the biological habits within Eurytominae. The common ancestor of Buresiinae is presumed to parasitize insects (mostly at the egg stage) living in grass stems. (C) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.},

The analysis yielded the generic relationships: ((Habrophorula, Elaphropoda) (Habropoda (Deltoptila (Pachymelus (Amegilla, Anthophora))))). The monophyly of the Anthophorini and each of its genera was confirmed. A second tribe, Habropodini, as postulated by some authors, is paraphyletic.

The northern part of south-east Asia (India to south-east China) is regarded as the most probable place of origin and radiation of the Anthophorini.

Nine, especially cleptoparasitic species, were newly added. Analyses were performed by maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Trees inferred from the analysis of the complete dataset were rooted by taxa from the families Melittidae and Megachilidae. Unrooted trees inferred from the analysis of the partial dataset (excluding outgroup taxa) are also presented to preclude possible negative effects of the outgroup on the topology of the ingroup. Only the subfamily Nomadinae was statistically well supported. The monophyly of the subfamilies Xylocopinae and Apinae was not topologically recovered. The monophyly of the tribe Tetrapediini was supported, and this tribe was found to be related to xylocopine taxa. At the very least, larval morphology suggests that Tetrapedia is not a member of the subfamily Apinae. Our analyses support the monophyly of the Eucerine line (Emphorini, Eucerini, Exomalopsini, Tapinotaspidini) and of the Apine line (Anthophorini, Apini, Bombini, Centridini, Euglossini, Meliponini). All analyses support the monophyly of totally cleptoparasitic tribes of the subfamily Apinae. We named this group the Melectine line (Ericrocidini, Isepeolini, Melectini, Osirini, Protepeolini, Rhathymini). In previous studies all these cleptoparasitic tribes were considered independent evolutionary lineages. Our results suggest that their similarities with hosts in morphology and pattern are probably the result of convergence and host-parasite co-evolution than phylogenetic affinity. According to the present analysis, the cleptoparasitism has evolved independently only six times within the family Apidae.},

	abstract = {The alpha-proteobacteria of the genus Wolbachia is a widespread group of maternally inherited endosymbionts of arthropod and nematode hosts. Wolbachia infection induces a range of host phenotypes, including cytoplasmic incompatibility, male killing, feminization, and induction of thelytokous parthenogenesis. Heterogony (cyclical parthenogenesis) is a remarkable characteristic of oak gallwasps, Cynipini, the largest tribe of the Cynipidae. A few species of Cynipini are exceptional in that they are univoltine and exhibit thelytokous parthenogenesis, probably because they lost the arrhenotokous generation of their heterogonic ancestor species due to Wolbachia infection. In this study, the presence of Wolbachia was detected using polymerase chain reaction primers for the wsp genes in a thelytokous parthenogenetic species [Dryocosmus kuriphilus (Yasumatsu)] (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Cynipini). Approximately 29.8 and 87.1\% of adults of the Zhuzhou and Fuzhou strains, respectively, were infected with Wolbachia while all females of the remaining four strains collected from other localities in China were Wolbachia free. The length of the wsp fragment of Zhuzhou and Fuzhou strains was found to be 573 and 561 bp, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the bacterial wsp fragment indicated that the endosymbiotic bacteria of the Zhuzhou and Fuzhou strains are members of supergroup A, but belong to different clades; they probably originated from two independent infection events. In conclusion, thelytokous parthenogenesis of D. kuriphilus is not caused by Wolbachia infection and the deletion of the arrhenotokous generation is thus not associated with such an infection.},

	abstract = {The braconid wasp subfamily Doryctinae mainly comprises idiobiont ectoparasitoids of other insect larvae. In recent years, however, members of a few genera have been discovered to be associated with galls from various unrelated host plant families, with some of these being gall inducers whereas others are suspected as being predators of gallers. Because of their considerable morphological differences, these gall-associated taxa traditionally have been placed in separate tribes or even in other subfamilies. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships among representatives of a number of different doryctine genera, including five of its seven gall-associated genera using two genetic markers. Here we analyzed the length-variable 28S sequence data based on secondary structure both excising the unalignable regions and recoding them according to indel length. In addition, multiple alignments were carried out with a range of gap-opening and extension parameters. The combined ( 28S + CO1) phylogenetic hypotheses obtained, both excluding and recoding the unalignable regions, recover a clade comprising the five gall-associated genera, and most of the analyses using multiple alignments also support this relationship. These results support a scenario in which secondary phytophagy evolves from initially attacking primary gall-forming hosts. The relationships recovered are also more congruent with a model that explains the macroevolution of insect plant association in the Doryctinae as reflecting geographic proximity rather than host plant relationships. Further, our phylogenctic hypotheses consistently show that one of the main morphological features employed in the higher level classification of the Doryctinae is actually highly homoplastic.

	abstract = {The Platygastroidea are a diverse group of mostly small to tiny wasps, the common biology for which is endoparasitism of insect and spider eggs. No analytically-based phylogeny exists for the superfamily, and the current suprageneric classification is flawed in part because of its reliance on homoplasious and pleisiomorphic morphological characters. To determine platygastroid relationships as a basis for investigating host and ovipositor evolution, phylogenies of {\textgreater} 70 in-group species (representing 55 genera) were reconstructed by parsimony and Bayesian methods using three molecular markers; the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and the nuclear genes 28S and 18S rRNA. The results strongly support the monophyly of the superfamily and one of the two families, Platygastridae, but the Scelionidae are most likely polyphyletic. However, within the Scelionidae, there is a well supported `main scelionid clade' that contains the majority of genera assigned to the family. At the subfamilial level, both putative subfamilies of Platygastridae, the Platygastrinae, and Sceliotrachelinae, are likely to be polyphyletic. Within the Scelionidae, both the Teleasinae and Telenominae are monophyletic, but the Scelioninae is clearly not so. The current tribal classification for the Scelionidae is in need of major reassessment because no tribes, with the exception of the Scelionini s.s., were found to be monophyletic. Further illustrating the problems associated with the current classification is the nonmonophyly of a number of genera, namely Opisthacantha Caloteleia, Telenomus, Trimorus, Teleas and Idris. Analysis of ovipositor evolution in the superfamily revealed that the Ceratobaeus-type ovipositor system is ancestral; however, this trait was lost prior to the evolution of the main scelionid clade, for which the Scelio-type ovipositor system is ancestral and defines a mostly paraphyletic assemblage. Ancestral state analysis indicates that the Ceratobaeus-type ovipositor was subsequently re-evolved in the main scelionid clade, representing a possible contradiction of Dollo's law. Previously, the tribal placement has been used to predict the host associations of genera for which host data were unavailable. However, the fact that most tribes are not monophyletic throws into doubt any such speculation based on the current classification. (C) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.},

A cladistic analysis supports the classification of this species among the Macropidinae (Melittidae).

Moreover, the morphology and disposition of the setae of R eocenicus are similar to those of the contemporary oil-collecting bee Macropis. The presence of a bee with such specialized structures would support the hypothesis that a close relationship existed between bees and oil flowers since the early Eocene.

These nuclear copies of mitochondrial sequences (numts) are scattered all over the honeybee chromosomes and have originated by multiple independent insertions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as evident by phylogenetic analysis. Apart from original insertions, moderate duplications of numts also contributed to the present pattern and distribution of mitochondrial sequences, in honeybee chromosomes. Assimilation of mitochondrial genes in the nuclear genome is mediated by extensive fragmentations of the original inserts. Replication slippage seems to be a major mechanism by which small sequences are inserted or deleted from mtDNA destined to nucleus. Most or the honeybee numts (84\%) are located in the nongenic regions. The majority (94\%) of the numts that are located in predicted nuclear genes have originated from mitochondrial genes coding for cytochrome oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase subunits. On the other hand, the mitochondrial rRNA or tRNA gene sequences are predominantly (88\%) located in nongenic regions of the genome. Evidences also support for exertion of purifying selection on numts located in specific genes. Comparative analysis of numts of European, African, and Africanized honeybees suggests that numt evolution in A. mellifera is probably not demarked by speciation time frame but may be a continuous and dynamic process.},

A phylogenetic analysis of the lecontei species group revealed extensive discordance between a contiguous mitochondrial region spanning three genes (COI, tRNA-leucine, and COII) and three nuclear loci (EF1 alpha, CAD, and an anonymous nuclear locus). Bayesian tests of monophyly and Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) tests of topological congruence were consistent with mitochondrial introgression; however, these patterns could also be explained by lineage sorting (i.e., deep coalescence). Therefore, to explicitly test the mitochondrial introgression hypothesis, we used a novel application of coalescent-based isolation with migration (IM) models to measure interspecific gene flow at each locus. In support of our hypothesis, mitochondrial gene flow was consistently higher than nuclear gene flow across 120 pairwise species comparisons (P {\textless} 1 x 10(-12)). We combine phylogenetic and coalescent evidence to identify likely cases of recent and ancient introgression in Neodiprion, and based on these observations, we hypothesize that shared hosts and/or pheromones facilitate hybridization, whereas disparate abundances between hybridizing species promote mitochondrial introgression. Our results carry implications for phylogenetic analysis, and we advocate the separation of high and low gene flow regions to inform analyses of hybridization and speciational history, respectively.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic studies on insect social parasites have found very close host-parasite relationships, and these have often been interpreted as providing evidence for sympatric speciation. However, such phylogenetic inferences are problematic because events occurring after the origin of parasitism, such as extinction, host switching and subsequent speciation, or an incomplete sampling of taxa, could all confound the interpretation of phylogenetic relationships. Using a tribe of bees where social parasitism has repeatedly evolved over a wide time-scale, we show the problems associated with phylogenetic inference of sympatric speciation. Host-parasite relationships of more ancient species appear to support sympatric speciation, whereas in a case where parasitism has evolved very recently, sympatric speciation can be ruled out. However, in this latter case, a single extinction event would have lead to relationships that support sympatric speciation, indicating the importance of considering divergence ages when analysing the modes of social parasite evolution.

	abstract = {Bumble bees (Bombus Latreille) occupy a wide diversity of habitats, from alpine meadows to lowland tropical forest, yet they appear to be similar in morphology throughout their range, suggesting that behavioural adaptations play a more important role in colonizing diverse habitats. Notwithstanding their structural homogeneity, bumble bees exhibit striking inter- and intraspecific variation in colour pattern, purportedly the outcome of mimetic evolution. A robust phylogeny of Bombus would provide the framework for elucidating the history of their wide biogeographical distribution and the evolution of behavioural and morphological adaptations, including colour pattern. However, morphological studies of bumble bees have discovered too few phylogenetically informative characters to reconstruct a robust phylogeny. Using DNA sequence data, we report the first nearly complete species phylogeny of bumble bees, including most of the 250 known species from the 38 currently recognized subgenera. Bayesian analysis of nuclear (opsin, EF-1 alpha, arginine kinase, PEPCK) and mitochondrial (16S) sequences results in a highly resolved and strongly supported phylogeny from base to tips, with clear-cut support for monophyly of most of the conventional morphology-based subgenera. Most subgenera fall into two distinct clades (short-faced and long-faced) associated broadly with differences in head morphology. Within the short-faced clade is a diverse New World clade, which includes nearly one-quarter of the currently recognized subgenera, many of which are restricted to higher elevations of Central and South America. The comprehensive phylogeny provides a firm foundation for reclassification and for evaluating character evolution in the bumble bees. (c) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.},

	abstract = {The complete 16,434-bp nucleotide sequence of the mitogenome of the humble bee, Bombus ignitus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), was determined. The genome contains the base composition and codon usage typical of metazoan mitogenomes. An unusual feature of the B. ignitus mitogenome is the presence of five tRNA-like structures: two each of the tRNA(Leu(UUR))-like and tRNA(Ser(AGN))-like sequences and one tRNA(Phe)-like sequence. These tRNA-like sequences have proper folding structures and anticodon sequences, but their functionality in their respective amino acid transfers remained uncertain. Among these sequences, the tRNA(Leu(UUR))-like sequence and the tRNA(Ser(AGN))-like sequence are seemingly located within the A+T-rich region. This tRNA(Ser(AGN))-like sequence is highly unusual in that its sequence homology is very high compared to the tRNA(Met) of other insects, including Apis mellifera, but it contains the anticodon ACT, which designates it as tRNA(Ser(AGN)). All PCG and rRNAs are conserved in positions observed most frequently in insect mitogenome structures, but the positions of the tRNAs are highly variable, presenting a new arrangement for an insect mitogenome. As a whole, the B. ignitus mitogenome contains the highest A+T content (86.9\%) found in any of the complete insects mt sequences determined to date. All protein-coding sequences started with a typical ATN codon. Nine of the 13 PCGs have a complete termination codon (all TAA), but the remaining four genes terminate with the: incomplete TA or T. All tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structures of mt tRNAs, except for tRNA(Ser(AGN)), in which the DHU arm forms a simple loop. All anticodons of B. ignitus tRNAs are identical to those of A. mellifera. In the A+T-rich region, a highly conserved sequence block that was previously described in Orthoptera and Diptera was also present. The stem-and-loop structures that may play a role in the initiation of mtDNA replication were also found in this region. Phylogenetic analysis among three corbiculate tribes, represented by Melipona bicolor (Meliponini), A. mellifera (Apini), and B. ignitus (Bombini), showed the closest relationship between M bicolor and B. ignitus.

As honeybee workers compete pheromonally for reproductive dominance, and as A. m. capensis workers readily produce queen-like pheromones, we hypothesized that these semiochemicals promoted the evolution of intraspecific social parasitism. Remarkably, the offspring of a single worker became established as a parasite in A. m. scutellata's range. This could have resulted from extreme selection among different clonal parasitic worker lineages. Using pheromonal contest experiments, we show that the selected parasitic lineage dominates in the production of mandibular gland pheromones over all other competitors to which it is exposed. Our results suggest that mandibular gland pheromones played a key role in the evolution of intraspecific social parasitism in the honeybee and in the selection of a single genotype of parasitic workers.},

	abstract = {Figs (Ficus spp., Moraceae) and their pollinating wasps (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae, Chalcidoidea) constitute a classic example of an obligate plant-pollinator mutualism, and have become an ideal system for addressing questions on coevolution, speciation, and the maintenance of mutualisms. In addition to pollinating wasps, figs host several types of nonpollinating, parasitic wasps from a diverse array of Chalcid subfamilies with varied natural histories and ecological strategies (e.g. competitors, gallers, and parasitoids). Although a few recent studies have addressed the question of codivergence between specific genera of pollinating and nonpollinating fig wasps, no study has addressed the history of divergence of a fig wasp community comprised of multiple genera of wasps associated with a large number of sympatric fig hosts. Here, we conduct phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences (COI) using 411 individuals from 69 pollinating and nonpollinating fig wasp species to assess relationships within and between five genera of fig wasps (Pegoscapus, Idarnes, Heterandrium, Aepocerus, Physothorax) associated with 17 species of New World Urostigma figs from section Americana. We show that host-switching and multiple wasp species per host are ubiquitous across Neotropical nonpollinating wasp genera. In spite of these findings, cophylogenetic analyses (TREEMAP 1.0, TREEMAP 2.02 beta, and PARAFIT) reveal evidence of codivergence among fig wasps from different ecological guilds. Our findings further challenge the classical notion of strict-sense coevolution between figs and their associated wasps, and mirror conclusions from detailed molecular studies of other mutualisms that have revealed common patterns of diffuse coevolution and asymmetric specialization among the participants.},

The dwarf honey bees were confirmed as basal, and the giant and cavity-nesting species to be monophyletic. All nodes were strongly supported except that grouping Apis cerana with A. nigrocincta. Two thousand post-burnin trees from the phylogenetic analysis were used in a Bayesian comparative analysis to explore the evolution of dance type, nest structure, comb structure and dance sound within Apis. The ancestral honey bee species was inferred with high support to have nested in the open, and to have more likely than not had a silent vertical waggle dance and a single comb. The common ancestor of the giant and cavity-dwelling bees is strongly inferred to have had a buzzing vertical directional dance. All pairwise combinations of characters showed strong association, but the multiple comparisons problem reduces the ability to infer associations between states between characters. Nevertheless, a buzzing dance is significantly associated with cavity-nesting, several vertical combs, and dancing vertically, a horizontal dance is significantly associated with a nest with a single comb wrapped around the support, and open nesting with a single pendant comb and a silent waggle dance.

	abstract = {Background: Army ants are the prime arthropod predators in tropical forests, with huge colonies and an evolutionary derived nomadic life style. Five of the six recognized subgenera of Old World Dorylus army ants forage in the soil, whereas some species of the sixth subgenus (Anomma) forage in the leaf-litter and some as conspicuous swarm raiders on the forest floor and in the lower vegetation (the infamous driver ants). Here we use a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Dorylus s.l. army ants and to infer the evolutionary transitions in foraging niche and associated morphological adaptations. Results: Underground foraging is basal and gave rise to leaf-litter foraging. Leaf-litter foraging in turn gave rise to two derived conditions: true surface foraging (the driver ants) and a reversal to subterranean foraging (a clade with most of the extant Dorylus s.s. species). This means that neither the subgenus Anomma nor Dorylus s.s. is monophyletic, and that one of the Dorylus s.s. lineages adopted subterranean foraging secondarily. We show that this latter group evolved a series of morphological adaptations to underground foraging that are remarkably convergent to the basal state. Conclusion: The evolutionary transitions in foraging niche were more complex than previously thought, but our comparative analysis of worker morphology lends strong support to the contention that particular foraging niches have selected for very specific worker morphologies. The surprising reversal to underground foraging is therefore a striking example of convergent morphological evolution.},

Evidence for monophyly of the genera is presented and the following phylogenetic relationships are hypothesized: Galloromma + (Archaeromma + (Zealaromma + (Mymaromella + (Palaeomymar + Mymaromma)))). Absence of mesotibial and metatibial spurs are newly proposed synapomorphies for Mymarommatoidea. New information is given on the structure of Serphitidae (Serphitoidea) based on study of several Taimyr and Canadian Cretaceous fossils, and structural features that are shared among Serphitoidea, Mymarommatoidea, Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea are discussed relative to establishing their relationships. Several features, including gastral laterotergites, a mesopectal region similar to a netrion, and a forewing venation that could be ancestral to that of Platygastroidea suggest Serphitoidea is closely related to Platygastroidea. No new evidence was found to support a Serphitoidea + Mymarommatoidea sister-group relationship. Independent parameres in the groundplan of the male genitalia of Mymarommatoidea and Serphitoidea is a likely symplesiomorphy that differentiates them from Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea. Two different types of specialized claval sensilla could support monophyly of Mymarommatoidea + Chalcidoidea, but further study throughout parasitic Hymenoptera is necessary to substantiate character-state distribution and homology.},

The phylogeny produced, the first of any kind for the family, utilizes 121 taxa in fifty-two of the eighty-four recognized genera. Results were inferred from the ribosomal RNA regions 18S, 28S-D2 and 28S-D3, all aligned according to secondary structure models. Parsimony analysis was performed on both a complete and reduced dataset, in which ambiguous regions as defined by secondary structure were eliminated. The reduced dataset produced a much less resolved phylogenetic hypothesis. Only the complete dataset was utilized for Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. A robust-choice Bayesian hypothesis stemmed from the concatenation of five distinct character set parameters. The results are compared with the current classification based primarily on male genitalia. Although our conclusions are partially congruent with the accepted hypothesis of trichogrammatid relationships, none of the currently adopted assemblages was recovered as monophyletic. Nevertheless, the structure of the male genitalia does correspond with relative taxon position in the molecular hypotheses. In general, the greatest genitalic simplification and fusion characterizes taxa treated as the most derived in the molecular hypotheses. Several groups are consistently recovered, but relationships between these groups and other genera vary with the analytical method. A new classification of the Trichogrammatidae is proposed. It includes one tribe, Trichogrammatini, within the subfamily Trichogrammatinae, and three tribes, Paracentrobiini, Chaetostrichini and Oligositini, within the Oligositinae. All tribes are more narrowly defined than previously and many genera are treated as incertae sedis within each subfamily. The results are interpreted in the light of morphological evidence, and the placement of genera not represented in molecular analysis is inferred by morphology alone. Host associations throughout the family are varied, although the molecular results suggest that Trichogrammatidae primitively parasitized Coleoptera, with more recent radiations onto other insect orders, such as Lepidoptera and Hemiptera.},

One of the caveats of implied weights analysis is that it lacks an objective criterion for selecting the value of the concavity function. In the present study, differential weighting was used to explore the sensitivity of our results to the alternative assumptions made in the analysis and to select one of the most parsimonious trees under equal weights, which we regard as being the hypothesis that minimizes the amount of ad hoc assumptions. The validity of the two existing tribes and the monophyly of all the genera of Charipinae were tested, in particular the cosmopolitan and highly species-rich Alloxysta and Phaenoglyphis, which appear repeatedly in ecological and biochemical studies of host-parasitoid associations. The evolution of several major characters and the relationships between genera are discussed. On the basis of the phylogenetic results, we discuss a number of taxonomic issues. A new classification of the subfamily is proposed in which no tribes are maintained, Carvercharips is synonymyzed with Alloxysta, and the creation of a new genus from Nepal is justified. Our analysis points to the need for a world revision of the basal genus Phaenoglyphis, which is shown as paraphyletic.},

It has become apparent that forms of social organization, caste determination, and sex allocation are more labile and complex than previously thought, although the terminologies for describing them are still inadequate. Furthermore, the unexpected complexity means that many key parameters in kin selection and reproductive skew models remain unquantified, and addressing this lack of information will be formidable. At the same time, phylogenetic questions have become more tractable, and DNA sequence-based studies have resolved questions that earlier studies could not resolve, radically changing our understanding of the number of origins and losses of sociality in these bees.},

The invasion of Jamaica's citrus by T citricida resulted in serious economic losses and the importation and consideration was given to the establishment of Lipolexis oregmae Gahan (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) in a classical biological control program. Prior to introducing L. oregmae, we conducted a survey to determine the abundance of Lysiphlebus testaceipes Cresson (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) in T citricida. A high-fidelity PCR analysis was conducted using Lysiphlebus- and Lipolexis-specific ITS2 rRNA primers on alcohol-preserved brown citrus aphids and the results were positive for both parasitoids. The fortuitous establishment of L. oregmae in Jamaica was surprising, and was confirmed by rearing adults from parasitized aphids and obtaining taxonomic confirmation based on morphology. In addition, its identity was confirmed molecularly by cloning and sequencing 16S, 12S, and COI sequences from the Florida colony of L. oregmae and from Jamaican specimens. The three DNA sequences were 100\% identical for specimens from both sources. The phylogenetic analysis using 16S sequences indicated a close relationship of the Florida and Jamaica populations of L. oregmae with L. gracilis. During 2005, an island-wide survey of citrus in six parishes confirmed that both L. testaceipes and L. oregmae commonly parasitize T citricida, but that L. oregmae was the more widely distributed and abundant parasitoid.

A classical biological control program against H. vitripennis was initiated in 2004 aiming to introduce the exotic egg parasitoid Gonatocerus ashmeadi ( Girault) ( Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) to the Society Islands archipelago. Prior to any release, two risks were assessed: ( a) continued uncontrolled H. vitripennis spread and proliferation in French Polynesia, and ( b) non- target impacts by G. ashmeadi on indigenous French Polynesian cicadellids. The primary risk of H. vitripennis is its potential to vector the lethal plant bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa. While the presence of X. fastidiosa in French Polynesia has not yet been demonstrated, the presence of uncontrolled H. vitripennis greatly elevates the risk of a disease outbreak and thus represents a major threat for numerous plant species. Assessing the risk of G. ashmeadi introduction for native cicadellids first required an inventory of the Cicadellidae of the Society Islands, resulting in at least 14 cicadellid species ( nine not previously recorded). The risk to these species of attack by G. ashmeadi was assessed using four criteria: ( 1) their phylogenetic relationships to known hosts of G. ashmeadi, and their similarity in ( 2) body size, ( 3) egg laying biology, and ( 4) ecology. All indigenous cicadellid species found were considered to be at low risk of attack because they differed greatly from all known hosts for G. ashmeadi: ( 1) none of the indigenous species are in the tribe Proconiini, ( 2) all were very small and, when possible to determine, ( 3) lay tiny single eggs, which ( 4) are deposited on the undersides of leaves of trees. These results persuaded the French Polynesian Government that the benefits of establishing G. ashmeadi for H. vitripennis control outweighed the serious potential risks associated with either delaying release or not releasing G. ashmeadi in French Polynesia. Releases of G. ashmeadi in Tahiti began in May 2005.},

Although all other cynipid inquilines develop in galls induced by cynipid wasps, or very rarely cecidomyiid midges, R. loewi is the only cynipid inquiline of a lepidopteran gall, inducing secondary inquiline cells in galls induced by a cecidosid moth genus Scyrotis on Rhus species (Anacardiaceae). Rhoophilus is a lethal inquiline; its larval cells expand into the hollow interior of the host gall resulting in death of the gall inducer. Rhoophilus loewi is redescribed and the final-instar larva described for the first time. We describe host-plant associations, the morphology and phenology of gall formation, and the suite of parasitoid Hymenoptera associated with these galls. The community centred on Scyrotis galls is compared with those observed in other hosts of inquiline cynipids. Elucidation of the life history of R. loewi has fundamental implications for understanding the evolution of cynipid wasps.

We surveyed and observed nests in the field, and performed foraging bioassays and dissected nests in the laboratory. We determined the size and contents of nests in field populations. Nests found near other nests were not statistically different in size compared to nests found alone. There was also no statistical difference between near and lone nests regarding the presence of a queen in the nest. Most nests contained one queen with brood and workers, regardless of their proximity to other nests. Observations also were made of foraging and trail-marking behaviors. Foraging activity observed in the field revealed that workers left the nest area and followed trails upwards into the canopy, but they did not interact with foragers from other nearby nests. In a laboratory foraging arena, foragers marked a trail to a food source by dragging the gaster. Bioassays showed that A. collare workers preferred their own foraging trails, but not those of other conspecific colonies. All results suggest that each nest represents an independent colony, supporting a previous report that nests found in close proximity do not constitute a polydomous colony.},

In this study, the evolutionary dynamics of a Batesian mimicry system of model ants and ant-mimicking salticids is investigated by comparing the phylogenies of the two groups. Although Batesian mimics are expected to coevolve with their models, we found the phylogenetic patterns of the models and the mimics to be indicative of adaptive radiation by the mimic rather than co-speciation between the mimic and the model. This shows that there is strong selection pressure on Myrmarachne, leading to a high degree of polymorphism. There is also evidence of sympatric speciation in Myrmarachne, the reproductive isolation possibly driven by female mate choice in polymorphic species.},

The following three categories of chalcidoids are treated in the present article (i) gall inducers (ii) gall inquilines and (iii) parasitoids attacking the gall inducers and gall inquilines. Gall-inducing chalcidoids mostly belong to Agaonidae, Eulophidae, Eurytomidae, Pteromalidae, Tanaostigmatidae, and Torymidae. The families of Chalcidoidea associated with plant galls in widely varying degrees of dependence are Aphelinidae, Encyrtidae, Trichogrammatidae, Eupelmidae, Mymaridae, Ormyridae, and Chalcididae. Several hypotheses explain the phylogeny of Chalcidoidea. Morphological features tend to support the monophyletic origin of Chalcidoidea. However, no hypothesis is acceptable totally to a chalcidologist, since a comprehensive knowledge on the distribution of the character states throughout the superfamily is lacking. Gall induction arose more then once in the six families referred above. The biogeography of gall-associated Chalcidoidea is related to the distribution of their respective host plants. The Oriental chalcidoids are not isolated from the nearby Asiatic and Middle-eastern countries. Even the Palearctic and Ethiopian elements are quite frequently met with in the Oriental region.},

Recorded species richness for all cynipid groups in the eastern Palearctic is probably significantly underestimated, and we predict that this will be particularly true for gallwasps associated with oaks in the subgenera Quercus and Cyclobalanopsis, and perhaps for related host plants in the Fagaceae. We summarize what is known for all gallwasp tribes in the region extending from Pakistan to Japan and south to Indonesia, and highlight contributions that work in this region has made to understand the biology of this group as a whole.

Identity of honeybee subspecies was confirmed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences. Based on DNA sequence variation, a PCR primer specific for AHB was designed.

Parsimony analyses were more sensitive to both taxon sampling and the analytical model than Bayesian analyses, and analyses using the protein dataset did not recover the test phylogeny.

Understanding the processes underlying the evolution of specific oak associations requires knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships among oak gallwasp genera. Although three major lineages of oak gallwasps have been identified, the status and relationships of several species-poor but biologically significant genera remain unresolved. Two such genera are Chilaspis and Dryocosmus, whose western palaearctic species all gall oaks in the section Cerris. Dryocosmus is particularly significant biologically because it includes: (a) the only palaearctic gallwasp to gall chestnuts, Castanea, and (b) nearctic species. The oak section Cerris is wholly absent from the nearctic, and the relationship between palaearctic and nearctic Dryocosmus is significant for patterns of host plant evolution in the tribe as a whole. We examined the relationships between Chilaspis, Dryocosmus and other oak cynipid genera using cladograms from sequence data for two mitochondrial loci (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b) and two nuclear loci (the 28S ribosomal gene regions D2 and D3-5). Our analyses support the following conclusions: (1) palaearctic Chilaspis and Dryocosmus species form an intermingled monophyletic group. (2) We propose that Chilaspis Mayr, 1881 is a syn.n. of Dryocosmus Giraud, 1859 and propose the name D. mayri as a comb.rev. for the species previously named C. mayri, and D. nitidus and D. israeli as comb.n. of C. nitida and C. israeli, respectively. (3) We reassess the utility of morphological characters previously regarded as diagnostic for these genera. (4) Two species previously known only from a single generation represent two halves of a single species lifecycle. Dryocosmus nervosus is here designated a syn.n. of D. cerriphilus. (5) The nearctic species D. favus lies outside the palaearctic Chilaspis/Dryocosmus clade, and Dryocosmus as currently recognized is not a monophyletic group. (6) Dryocosmus/Chilaspis is closely related to the other oak gallwasp taxa (Aphelonyx, Plagiotrochus, Pseudoneuroterus, Trichagalma, and some Neuroterus species) galling section Cerris oaks. This implies an early branching evolution of this oak association within this group, and supports previous work showing the rarity of oak gallwasp host shifts.},

	abstract = {The obligate mutualism between fig trees and their fig wasp pollinators, together with the general tendency for each host species to be pollinated by one fig wasp species, led to the hypothesis that these two lineages have cospeciated. The pollinators of African figs of section Galoglychia form a diverse group of genera whose species seem to be less constrained to a specific host than other pollinating fig wasp genera. Various authors have suggested remarkably different phylogenetic relationships between the seven genera associated with section Galoglychia. These uncertainties concerning the classification make it difficult to understand the historical patterns of association between these wasps and their hosts. The phylogenetic tree for the pollinators was reconstructed with 28S, COI and ITS2 DNA sequence data and compared with morphological classification of the hosts. Pollinator genera were monophyletic in all analyses. However, the relative position of some genera remains unresolved. Investigation of host-fig association suggests that there have been frequent host jumps between host subsections. This indicates that cospeciation between fig trees and fig wasps is not as stringent as previously assumed. In addition, pollinators of the genus Alfonsiella associated with three host figs (Ficus craterostoma, F. stuhlmannii and F. petersii) are morphologically very similar in South Africa. We investigated the possibility that these pollinators form a complex of species with host-based genetic differentiation. Molecular analyses supported the distinction of the pollinator of F. craterostoma as a good species, but the pollinators of F. stuhlmannii and F. petersii clustered within the same clade, suggesting that these two host species share a single pollinator, Alfonsiella binghami. Based on both molecular data and morphological re-evaluation, a new Alfonsiella species is described, Alfonsiella pipithiensis sp. nov., which is the pollinator of F. craterostoma in southern Africa. A key to both females and males of all described species of Alfonsiella is provided.},

	abstract = {In many bees, wasps, and ants, workers police each other in order to prevent individual workers from selfishly producing their own male offspring. Although several factors can selectively favor worker policing, genetic relatedness is considered to be of special importance. In particular, kin selection theory predicts that worker policing should be more common in species where workers are more related to the queen's sons than to other workers' sons. Here we provide strong novel support for this theory based on a comparative analysis of policing and male parentage in 109 species of ants, bees, and wasps. First, an analysis of behavioral data confirms that worker policing occurs more frequently in species where workers are more related to the queen's sons than to other workers' sons. Second, an analysis of male parentage shows that a significantly higher percentage of the males are workers' sons in species where the workers are more related to other workers' sons. Both conclusions also hold if data are analyzed using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Although our analysis provides strong overall support for the theory that relatedness affects kin conflict over male parentage, there is also significant residual variation. Several factors that may explain this variation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Previous estimates of a generic level phylogeny for the ubiquitous parasitoid wasp subfamily Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera) have been problematic due to short internal branches deep in the phylogeny. These short branches might be attributed to a rapid radiation among the taxa, the use of genes that are unsuitable for the levels of divergence being examined, or insufficient quantity of data. We added over 1200 nucleotides from four nuclear genes to a dataset derived from three genes to produce a dataset of over 3000 nucleotides per taxon. While the number of well-supported short branches in the phylogeny increased, we still did not obtain strong bootstrap support for every node. Parametric and nonparametric bootstrap simulations projected that an enormous, and likely unobtainable, amount of data would be required to get bootstrap support greater than 50\% for every node. However, a marked increase in the number of well-supported nodes was seen when we conducted a Bayesian analysis of a combined dataset generated from morphological characters added to the seven gene dataset. Our results suggest that, in some cases, combining morphological and genetic characters may be the most practical way to increase support for short branches deep in a phylogeny.

The informal higher grouping of the ichneumonids were supported, but the relationship of the Ichneumoninae and Cryptinae was not resolved. Cryptinae tribes were supported but many genera formed constant groups that did not follow earlier subtribal divisions. We investigated artifactual placements of, e.g., Agriotypinae and Brachycyrtinae, and showed that they do not possess molecular synapomophies with the Ichenumoninae where direct optimization places them. The sequences of anomalous placed taxa were markedly longer (or in some cases shorter) than those of most other taxa, and this is explained by homoplastic indels at “hot spots” in the absence of large numbers of informative substitutions. We show that multiple alignment generally resulted in taxa with large insertions or deletions being placed in more plausible positions. The relationship of the genus Alomya is also explored.

	abstract = {Alysiinae currently contains over 1,500 described species and is divided into the tribes Alysiini and Dacnusini. There is disagreement on how species should be grouped within Dacnusini, and Chaenusa Haliday is a prime example. Chaenusa sensu lato is defined by the presence of setae on the compound eyes (Griffiths 1964). Alternatively, Riegel (1950, 1982) treated Chaenusa s.l. as three genera, Chaenusa sensu stricto, Chorebidea Viereck, and Chorebidella Riegel, and differentiated the genera primarily using forewing venation and shape of the forewing stigma. Phylogenetic analyses using molecular data have not been undertaken. Therefore, we assessed the monophyly and interspecific relationships of Chaenusa s.l., Chaenusa s.s., Chorebidea, and Chorebidella through maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses using mitochondrial NADH 1 dehydrogenase gene sequences. Chaenusa s.l. and Chorebidea were not monophyletic in any of the analyses, but four of five species of Chorebidea always formed a clade. Further, Chaenusa s.s. and Chorebidella were monophyletic in all analyses and were always sister taxa. The results of this study largely support Riegel's (1950, 1982) treatment of Chaenusa s.l. as Chaenusa s.s., Chorebidea, and Chorebidella. However, we suggest that Chaenusa s.l. be retained until additional phylogenetic analyses have been undertaken to confirm the relationships inferred in this study. In addition to the phylogenetic analyses, we discuss the morphological features relevant to Griffiths' definition of Chaenusa s.l. and Riegel's definition of Chaenusa s.s., Chorebidea, and Chorebidella.},

Maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the DNA sequence data show that: (1) Nematinae are monophyletic in a broad sense which includes Hoplocampa, Susana and the tribe Cladiini, which have been classified often into separate subfamilies; together with Craterocercus, these taxa form a paraphyletic basal grade with respect to the remaining Nematinae, but among-group relationships within the grade remain weakly resolved; (2) the remainder of the ingroup, Nematinae s. str, is monophyletic in all combined-data analyses; (3) within Nematinae s. str, the `Higher' Nematinae is divided into three groups, Mesoneura and the large tribes Nematini and Pristiphorini; (4) although the traditional classifications at the tribal level are largely upheld, some of the largest tribes and genera are obviously para- or polyphyletic; (5) according to rate-smoothed phylogenies dated with two fossil calibration points, Nematinae originated 50-120 million years ago. In addition, the results from all Bayesian analyses provide strong and consistent support for the monophyly of Tenthredinidae, which has been difficult to demonstrate in previous parsimony analyses of morphological and molecular data.},

Two species of Muscidifurax, Muscidifurax raptor Girault \& Sanders and Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan \& Legner (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) were included as outgroup taxa. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-1 region was highly variable among Spalangia species with many insertions/deletions making alignment of the sequences difficult. The D2-D3 region of the 28s ribosomal gene and the nuclear rDNA 18s gene were more conserved and enabled phylogenetic analysis. No genetic differentiation was observed among S. cameroni and S. endius samples from Kazakhstan, Russia, and North America. New World samples of S. nigroaenea are genetically distinct from S. slovaca, a morphologically similar Old World species that is newly recorded from Kazakhstan and Russia. The intact 920 bp ITS-I amplicon of S. nigroaenea was much larger than the 780-bp amplicon of S. slovaca. Kimura two-parameter genetic distance between the two species was 0.015 for the 28s region. Otherwise, the smallest genetic distance among recognized Spalangia species was 0.037 between S. endius and S. nigra. The genetic distance between M. raptor and M. zaraptor was 0.004. Based upon these results, the utility of the D2-D3 region of the 28s ribosomal gene is substantiated for differentiating species of Spalangia.

It is divided into six subgroups, of which the fasciola subgroup is the only one with most of its species found in the humid forests of Central and South America. With the aim of understanding the origin and evolution of the fasciola subgroup, and consequently adding information about the repleta group, we analyzed partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of nine Drosophila species (D. carolinae, D. coroica, D. ellisoni, D. fascioloides, D. ivai, D. moju, D. onca, D. rosinae and D. senei). The phylogenetic hypotheses obtained neither defined the relationships between the subgroups of the repleta group nor defined all the interspecific relationships in the fasciola subgroup. We found that the species D. carolinae, D. coroica, D. onca, D. rosinae and D. senei comprised a clade in which D. carolinae, D. onca and D. senei appeared together at a polytomy while D. fascioloides and D. ellisoni comprised another clade with a high bootstrap value.},

The acrosome consists of an acrosomal vesicle, oval shaped in cross sections, and a perforatorium, that projects into the anterior nuclear region. The nucleus is elongated and oval shaped in cross sections. The nucleus-flagellum transition region includes the centriolar adjunct, the nucleus base and the anterior portions of the axoneme and of the large mitochondrial derivative. The centriolar adjunct begins as a thin layer between the nucleus and the large mitochondrial derivative, while just below it acquires a lateral extension partially surrounding the large mitochondrial derivative. In its medial portion, it is triangular shaped, situated laterally to the axoneme and the large mitochondrial derivative, and it finishes in contact with the tip of the small mitochondrial derivative. The flagellum is composed of a 9 + 9 + 2 axoneme, two mitochondrial derivatives and two accessory bodies. The large mitochondrial derivative begins laterally to the nuclear base, and the small one below the centriolar adjunct. Only the large mitochondrial derivative presents a paracrystalline core, situated distally in relation to the axoneme. In the posterior flagellar region, the small mitochondrial derivative finishes first, followed by the large one and both accessory bodies. Although Vespidae belong to the superfamily Vespoidea, as Formicidae, the sperm ultrastructure of A. vicina is phylogenetically more closely related to Apoidea, and curiously very different from that observed for ants. This study supports the use of insect sperm morphology as a tool for phylogenetic analysis, especially in the Hymenoptera order.},

Recently the Ponerinae were reclassified into six poneromorph subfamilies based on morphological analysis. We evaluate this new poneromorph classification using 1240 base pairs of DNA sequence data obtained from 285 rRNA gene sequences of 68 terminal taxa. The molecular tree supported the monophyly of the ant family Formicidae, with 100\% parsimony bootstrap (PB) support and posterior probabilities (PP) of 1.00, with the ant subfamily Leptanillinae as a sister group to all other ants (PB=62, PP =93). However, our analyses strongly support the polyphyly of the Poneromorph subfamilies (sensu Bolton). The Ectatomminae and Heteroponerinae are more closely related to the Formicoid subfamilies than to the rest of the poneromophs (PB = 96, PP = 100). The Amblyoponinae (PB = 52, PP = 96), Paraponerinae (PB = 100, PP = 100), Ponerinae (PB {\textless} 50, PP = 71), and Proceratiinae (PB = 98, PP = 100) appear as distinct lineages at the base of the tree and are identified as a poneroid grade. Monophyletic origins for the poneroid subfamilies Amblyoponinae, Paraponerinae, Ponerinae and Proceratiinae are supported in our analysis. However, the genus Platythyrea forms a distinct sister group to the Ponerini within the Ponerinae. The Heteroponerinae, based on our sample of Heteroponera, are associated with the subfamily Ectatomminae (PB=98, PP = 100). Furthermore, our data indicate the genus Probolomyrmex belongs to the Proceratiinae as suggested by recent morphological analysis (PB = 98, PP =100). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Eusocial organisms are characterized by cooperative brood care, generation overlap and reproductive division of labour. Traits associated with eusociality are most developed in ants, termites, paper wasps and corbiculate bees; the fossil record indicates that each of these advanced eusocial taxa evolved in the Late Cretaceous or earlier (greater than 65 Myr ago). Halictid bees also include a large and diverse number of eusocial members, but, in contrast to advanced eusocial taxa, they are characterized by substantial intra- and inter-specific variation in social behaviour, which may be indicative of more recent eusocial evolution. To test this hypothesis, we used over 2400 bp of DNA sequence data gathered from three protein-coding nuclear genes (opsin, wingless and EF-1a) to infer the phylogeny of eusocial halictid lineages and their relatives. Results from relaxed molecular clock dating techniques that utilize a combination of molecular and fossil data indicate that the three independent origins of eusociality in halictid bees occurred within a narrow time frame between approximately 20 and 22 Myr ago. This relatively recent evolution helps to explain the pronounced levels of social variation observed within these bees. The three origins of eusociality appear to be temporally correlated with a period of global warming, suggesting that climate may have had an important role in the evolution and maintenance of eusociality in these bees.},

We then show how to use estimates of phylogenetic signals to predict novel consumer-resource associations solely from the phylogenetic position of species for which no other (or only partial) data are available. Finally, we show how to combine phylogenetic information with information about species' ecological characteristics and lifehistory traits to estimate the effects of species traits on consumerresource associations while accounting for phylogenies.

The genus-group is monophyletic, nested within the Ephialtini as (Iseropus (Gregopimpla (Tromatobia ((Zaglyptus + Clistopyga) + (Polysphincta genus-group))))). Within the Polysphincta genus-group, the clade (Piogaster + Inbioia) is sister-lineage to all other genera. The cosmopolitan genus Zabrachypus is nonmonophyletic, and has been subdivided into a monophyletic Nearctic/Western Palaearctic Zabrachypus s.str. and an Eastern Palaearctic Brachyzapusgen.n., comprising B. nikkoensis (Uchida) comb.n., B. tenuiabdominalis (Uchida) comb.n. and B. unicarinatus (Uchida \& Momoi) comb.n. An Afrotropical species placed in Zabrachypus, Z. curvicauda (Seyrig), belongs to Schizopygacomb.n. The monophyly of the cosmopolitan genus Dreisbachia is equivocal, and we consider that species assigned to it are best placed in an expanded Schizopyga (syn.n.). The monobasic Afrotropical genus Afrosphincta is also a synonym of Schizopyga (syn.n.). The newly delimited Schizopyga is the sister-lineage of Brachyzapus, and these two genera form the sister-lineage of Zabrachypus s.str. as the monophyletic clade (Zabrachypus + (Schizopyga + Brachyzapus)). The Holarctic genus Sinarachna is monophyletic if the Palaearctic species S. anomala (Holmgren) is excluded and transferred to Zatypotacomb.n. The European species Polysphincta nielseni Roman belongs to the Palaearctic genus Reclinervellus, and (Reclinervellus + Sinarachna) is the sister-lineage to a monophyletic group of undescribed Asian species herein assigned to a new genus, Chabliseagen.n. All remaining polysphinctine genera form a strongly monophyletic clade, the Polysphincta clade, although the relationship between this clade and the Chablisea and Zabrachypus clades remains an unresolved trichotomy. The Polysphincta clade comprises three lineages as an unresolved trichotomy, a monophyletic Oxyrrhexis, a major group ('Polysphincta' (Ticapimpla (Acrotaphus + Hymenoepimecis))) and an Acrodactyla lineage. In the second group, `Polysphincta' is paraphyletic with respect to the other three genera. However, we retain `Polysphincta' as a genus because few species of this very large genus were included in our analysis. We suspect that, when the tropical fauna is better known, it will be possible to subdivide `Polysphincta' into two or more monophyletic taxa. In the third lineage, the Acrodactyla lineage, the Holarctic genus Acrodactyla is monophyletic if the European species A. madida (Haliday) is excluded. Consequently, we erect a new genus Megaetairagen.n. for this species. The monobasic Afrotropical genus Pterinopus is the sister-lineage to the cosmopolitan genus Eruga. The very large cosmopolitan genus Zatypota seems to be monophyletic if two New World species, Z. parva (Cresson) and Z. gerardoi Gauld, Ugalde \& Hanson, are transferred to Flacopimplacomb.n. The expanded Flacopimpla is the sister-group to the Indo-Australian genus Eriostethus, and these two in turn form the sister-group to (Zatypota + Longitibia). This complex forms an unresolved tetrachotomy with (Pterinopus + Eruga), Acropimpla and Megaetaira. Formal descriptions of all genera are included, together with an illustrated key to the genera. Brief notes are given about the recorded hosts of each genus.},

Social parasitism has been suggested to yield necessary disruptive selection for sympatric speciation. Recently, mitochondrial DNA phylogeography has shown that the ant Myrmica microrubra is closely related to its host, Myrmica rubra, leading to the suggestion that sympatric speciation has occurred. We investigated the relationships between the two ant forms using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, microsatellite genotyping and morphometrics. Molecular phylogenetic and population structure analyses showed that M. microrubra does not evolve separately to its host but rather shares a gene pool with it. Probability analysis showed that mitochondrial DNA data previously adduced in favour of sympatric speciation do not in fact do so. Morphometrically, M. microrubra is most readily interpreted as a miniature queen form of M. rubra, not a separate species. Myrmica microrubra is not an example of speciation. The large (typical M. rubra) and small (M. microrubra) queen forms are alternative reproductive strategies of the same species.

We analyzed the combined and single gene data sets using parsimony and Bayesian methods, Which yielded largely congruent results. Our results provide reasonably strong support for family and subfamily-level relationships among bees. Our data set strongly supports the sister-group relationship of the Colletidae and Stenotritidae, and places Halictidae as sister to this clade combined. Our analyses place the Melittidae and the long-tongued (LT) bee clade (Apidae + Megachilidae) near the base of the tree with Colletidae (and Stenotritidae) in a fairly highly derived position. This topology (”Melittidae-LT basal”) was obtained in previods morphological studies under certain methods of character coding. A more widely accepted tree topology that places Colletidae (and/or Stenotritidae) as sister to all other bees (”Colletidae basal”) is not supported by our data. The “Melittidae-LT basal” hypothesis may better explain patterns in the bee fossil record as well as historical biogeography of certain bee groups. Our results provide new insights into higher-level bee phylogeny and indicate that CAD, RNA polymerase II, and 28S are useful data sets for resolving Cretaceous-age divergences in bees and other Hymenoptera.

	abstract = {Indels in DNA sequences frequently affect more than a single nucleotide, creating problems for alignment, character coding and phylogenetic analysis. However, the size and frequency of multiple-residue indels is not usually tested, and with popular alignment packages their reconstruction is indirectly acheived by reducing the affine (gap extension) cost. We explored the length distribution of indels in intron sequences of the gene Mp20 by modifying the gap opening and gap extension costs. Given a “known” tree for the study group, global homology levels were greatest under low gap cost, with gap extension costs of roughly 0.4-fold the opening cost. Different approaches to gap coding and weighting suggested that taxonomic congruence was correlated with high frequencies of multiple-position indels, with a maximum indel length of 2-5 bp and few indels above 15 bp, but also including a proportion of indels {\textgreater} 100 bp. Only a small minority of indels could be reconstructed as single- position indels. Consequently, tree topologies improved when homologous multinucleotide indels were recoded as binary characters which are otherwise highly homoplastic and weighted characters in single- position coding. In tree-generating alignment procedures as implemented in POY, where gap penalty determines the character weight during tree search, the problem of assigning inappropriately high weight to multiple-residue indels could partly be overcome by setting the extension costs to about 0.4-fold lower than gap opening costs. We conclude that multiple consecutive gap positions are not independent characters and hence methods for parsimony reconstruction of long indels are required. Finally, we also observed a general lack of correlation between taxonomic and character congruence, demonstrating the difficulties of applying congruence criteria to decide among competing alignments. This highlights the value of recent model-based alignment procedures which can implement the statistical distributions of indel size classes, and do not rely on potentially circular strategies for optimizing overall congruence.

The tree topology on the basis of 16S rRNA supports monophyly for members of Saturniidae and Bombycidae. Weighted parsimony analysis weighted towards transversions relative to transitions (ts, tv4) for coxI resulted in more robust bootstrap support over unweighted parsimony and favours the 16S rRNA tree topology. Combined analysis reflected clear biogeographic pattern, and agrees with morphological and cytological data.},

Previously, the African genera Aphomomyrmex Emery and Petalomyrmex Snelling were thought to be close relatives of Brachymyrmex as well, but our analysis, based on evidence from male genitalia, suggests this is not the case. The monotypic genus Pseudaphomomyrmex Wheeler, W.M, originally placed in the Formicinae and long thought to be a relative of Brachymyrmex, is transferred to the Dolichoderinae. Pseudaphomomyrmex lacks the most obvious synapomorphy of the Formicinae, an acidopore. The species possesses a “dolichoderine habitus.” Other morphological characteristics suggest placement within the Dolichoderinae. For instance, the juncture where the mandibular masticatory margin dolichoderines. The structure of the petiole also suggests placement within the subfamily.},

The higher level phylogeny of the Apoidea based on sequence data of a nuclear gene, long-wavelength (LW) opsin, is analysed for the first time. Although preliminary because of limited taxon sampling and use of a single gene, the analysis reveals some significant results. Monophyly of the Apoidea, including the Heterogynaidae, is supported strongly, as is monophyly of Heterogynaidae. The monophyly of the bees is also confirmed, but support is rather weak. Monophyly of the Ampulicidae + Sphecidae, which is the sister group to the remaining Apoidea (Crabronidae + Anthophila + Heterogynaidae), is confirmed. Our results imply that Sphecidae may be paraphyletic with respect to Ampulicidae, and Crabronidae with respect to bees and Heterogynaidae. Remarkably, Heterogynaidae is well nested within the Crabronidae + Anthophila clade, which is in conflict with the morphological data. This result implies that Heterogynaidae may not have originated from a basal node within Apoidea, as previously considered, and that the character states presumed to be plesiomorphies may instead be homoplasies. Our analysis confirms the value of LW opsin in resolving deeper nodes within Apoidea. A new species, Heterogyna nocticola Ohl, from the Sultanate of Oman is described based on both sexes, with a diagnosis, information on distribution and collecting period.

Emery's Rule states that social parasites are more closely related to their hosts than to any other species. By investigating the phylogenetic relationships among the parasites and their hosts using cladistic analysis, we attempted to determine if Emery's Rule applies to yellowjackets, as is thought to be the case for the ants on which the theory was based. Sixty-eight morphological and behavioral characters are presented to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among these species.

	abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that changes in male reproductive tactics are often associated with female receptivity or female density. We used a phylogenetic context, comparing three species of the parasitoid wasp Nasonia. Females of these species may emerge from the host puparium as virgins or having already mated (called within-host mating, WHM). Males vary in their probability of aggressively defending the host puparium after they emerge. We used six lines of Nasonia, two from each species, to test whether male aggressive tendencies were higher in species in which females emerge as virgins. During adult emergence from the host puparia, we scored female WHM and male aggressive behaviour, site fidelity and dispersal. We found a positive association between male and female behaviour at the species level. First, male N. vitripennis were highly aggressive and did not disperse, and 95\% of females emerged as virgins. In contrast, N. giraulti males showed little to no aggression and a high tendency to disperse after emerging from the host, and 100\% of females mated prior to emergence. Finally, for N. longicornis, both male aggressive behaviour and WHM were variable. Based on the molecular phylogeny of Nasonia, we hypothesize that the behavioural differences between males of N. vitripennis and N. giraulti represent the ancestral and derived states, respectively, and that N. longicornis is in an early stage of divergence from N. vitripennis. We suggest that WHM and decreased male aggression in male N. giraulti evolved as a response to the spread of the host generalist N. vitripennis.

Monophyly was supported for four groups (those of gulosa., nigrocincta, picta, and mandibularis) but the situation is unclear for four others (those of urens, aberrans, tepperi, and pilosula).

	abstract = {The interaction between figs and fig pollinators is one of the most species-specific mutualisms. Recently, phylogenies of both partners based on molecular data provided insights into a wide spectrum of co-evolutionary questions. However, for the phylogeny of fig pollinators, there are some discrepancies between different studies and left some relationships unresolved, especially for deep nodes. The phylogenetic uncertainties of pollinators prohibit our further understanding of the history of the mutualism. Here, we present phylogenetic analyses of a larger COI sequence dataset that includes previously published datasets and our sequences from 20 species using Bayesian method and maximum parsimony. The analyses using different methods share similar topologies. Bayesian analyses provide high level of confidence for most internal nodes in terms of posterior probability. This study also clarifies some discrepancies between previous studies. After rooting with Tetrapus, other pollinators split into two clades. Wiebesia and Blastophaga are at basal positions in respective clade. Ceratosolen is not monophyletic because Kradibia and Liporrhopalum fall inside this group. Three subgenera of Ceratosolen: subgen. Ceratosolen, subgen. Rothropus, and subgen. Strepitus are not supported. Therefore, Ceratosolen is suggested to be re-divided into three groups. Urostigma pollinators (including Dolichoris and Blastophaga psenes) are clustered together. The monophylies of Wiebesia, Blastophaga, Dolichoris are not supported in this analysis. This study also provides a new framework for re-evaluating character evolution and re-inspecting the definition of some genera. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1080/10635150500431148},
	abstract = {Previous phylogenetic studies of the bee tribe Allodapini suggested a puzzling biogeographic problem: one of the key basal divergences involved separation of the southern African and southern Australian clades at a very early stage in allodapine evolution, but no taxa occur in the Palaearctic or Asian regions that might suggest a Laurasian dispersal route. However, these studies lacked sufficient sequence data and appropriate maximum likelihood partition models to provide reliable phylogenetic estimates and enable alternative biogeographic hypotheses to be distinguished. Using Bayesian and penalized likelihood approaches and an expanded sequence and taxon set we examine phylogenetic relationships between the Australian, African, and Malagasy groups and estimate divergence times for key nodes. We show that divergence of the three basal Australian clades (known as the exoneurines) occurred at least 25 Mya following a single colonization event, and that this group diverged from the African + Madagascan clade at least 30 Mya, but actual divergence dates are likely to be much older than these very conservative limits. The bifurcation order of the exoneurine clades was not resolved and analyses could not rule out the existence of a hard polytomy, suggesting rapid radiation after colonization of Australia. Their divergence involved major transitions in life history traits and these placed constraints on the kinds of social organization that subsequently evolved in each lineage. Early divergence between the African, Malagasy, and Australian clades presents a major puzzle for historical biogeography: node ages are too recent for Gondwanan vicariance hypotheses, but too early for Laurasian dispersal scenarios. We suggest a scenario involving island hopping across the Indian Ocean via a series of now largely submerged elements of the Kergulen Plateau and Broken Ridge provinces, both of which are known to have had subaerial formations during the Cenozoic.},

Both are ground nesting; the nests of the former are attacked by the cleptoparasite Protosiris gigas Melo (Osirini), and those of the latter are attacked by Parepeolus minutus Roig-Alsina (Osirini). Egg eclosion, larval feeding behavior, and cocoon spinning of M. haemorrhoidalis are detailed. A female of P. gigas opens the closed cell of M. haemorrhoidalis by making a large opening in the cell cap (which is plugged after ovipositioning) through which she apparently extends her metasoma. Indirect evidence suggests that she uses her metasomal apex, and perhaps even the sting, to kill the host egg or early instar. Protosiris eggs are either attached to the cell-wall surface of the nearly vertical host cells or dropped onto the surface of the provisions. First instars of P. gigas, with strongly curved, sharply pointed mandibles, are also capable of killing host immatures or competing cleptoparasites. Cocoons of all four species are compared and contrasted. The egg, all larval instars, and pupa of Monoeca haemorrhoidalis are described, as are the egg and postdefecating larva of Lanthanomelissa betinae. The egg, all larval instars, and pupa of Protosiris gigas are described, as is the postdefecating larva of Parepeolus minutus. Both Monoeca haemorrhoidalis and Protosiris gigas have four ovarioles per ovary. The egg indices and other ovarian features of both species are identified and discussed. The possible phylogenetic relationship of the Tapinotaspidini with the Osirini is briefly explored on the basis of data from this study. Possible phylogenetic relationships of the Osirini with other cleptoparasitic apids are analyzed. In the appendix, the identity of the species of Monoeca, whose nesting biology is presented in the main paper, is discussed. The species is M. haemorrhoidalis (Smith, 1854), a species closely related to M. schrottkyi (Friese, 1902) and M. xanthopyga Harter-Marques, Cunha, and Moure, 2001. An identification key for distinguishing these three species is presented. Tetra-pedia piliventris Friese is placed as a junior synonym of M. haemorrhoidalis (new synonymy). A lectotype is designated for Pachycentris schrottkyi Friese. The species of Protosiris found attacking M. haemorrhoidalis is here described as new, P. gigas Melo sp. nov.

To obtain a robust phylogeny of the group, we obtained DNA sequences for 36 of the 43 species from four genes (mitochondrial 16S rRNA and three nuclear genes: elongation factor -1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), long wavelength rhodopsin (LW Rh or opsin) and arginine kinase (ArgK)). Both Bayesian and parsimony phylogenies are well resolved and indicate a monophyletic Pyrobombus when assessed against representatives of 20 additional subgenera. The more conserved nuclear genes, especially EF-1 alpha and ArgK, provided good support across all of the taxonomic levels examined, whereas support of the more rapidly evolving mt16S was restricted mostly to close relationships at the tips of the tree. The exon regions of ArgK were the most conserved and may be promising for higher-level phylogenetics. We discuss species relationships within Pyrobombus and its sister-group, Bombus s. s. + Alpinobombus, in relation to previous taxonomic studies.},

The topological effects of outgroup choice, method of phylogenetic analysis, and inclusion of the 18S data were systematically investigated, with particular focus on the relationship of the Chalcidoidea with other members of the Proctotrupomorpha (Platygastroidea, Proctotrupoidea, Cynipoidea). We report that ingroup topology was sensitive to the choice of outgroup, the method of phylogenetic analysis, and inclusion of 18S data. However, the Proctotrupomorpha were always monophyletic, and the Chalcidoidea were recovered, in every analysis except one, as the sister to the diaprioid complex (Diapriidae + Monomachidae + Maamingidae). The single exception, where the Chalcidoidea + Platygastroidea were recovered, utilised a more distant outgroup (Symphyta: Cephidae: Hartigia), maximum parsimony, and excluded the 18S data.

Within each clade, wasp species generally cluster according to their host classification. The phylogenies of the two clades are also generally more congruent than expected by chance. Together these results suggest that Otiteselline wasp speciation is largely constrained by the diversification of their hosts. Finally, we show a difference in ovipositor length between the two Otiteselline species coexisting in the same Ficus species, which probably corresponds to ecological differences. The diversification of ecological niches within the fig is probably, with cospeciation, one of the key factors explaining the diversification and maintenance of species of parasites of the fig/pollinator system.},

The treatment of sequence length variation of the 28S partition was explored by either excluding ambiguously aligned regions and indel information (28SN) or recoding them (28SA) using the `fragment-level' alignment method with a modified coding approach. Bayesian MCMC analyses were performed for the separate and combined data sets and a maximum parsimony analysis was also carried out for the simultaneous molecular and morphological data sets. There was a significant incongruence between the two genes and between 28S and morphology, but not for morphology and Col. Different analyses with the 28SA data matrix resulted in topologies that were generally similar to the ones from the 28SN matrix; however, the former topologies recovered a higher number of significantly supported clades and had a higher mean Bayesian posterior probability, thus supporting the inclusion of information from ambiguously aligned regions and indel events in phylogenetic analyses where possible. Based on the significantly supported clades obtained from the simultaneous molecular and morphological analyses, we propose that a total of 17 subfamilies should be recognized within the cyclostome group. The subfamilial placements of several problematic cyclostome genera were also established. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The systematics of South American fire ants (Solenopsis saevissima species-group) has been plagued by difficulties in recognizing species and their relationships on the basis of morphological characters. We surveyed mtDNA sequences from 623 individuals representing 13 described and undescribed species within the species-group and 18 individuals representing other major Solenopsis lineages to generate a phylogeny of the mitochondrial genome. Our analyses support the monophyly of the S. saevissima species-group, consistent with a single Neotropical origin and radiation of this important group of ants, as well as the monophyly of the socially polymorphic species within the group, consistent with a single origin of polygyny (multiple queens per colony) as a derived form of social organization. The mtDNA sequences of the inquiline social parasite S. daguerrei form a clade that appears to be distantly related to sequences from the several host species, consistent with the view that advanced social parasitism did not evolve via sympatric speciation of intraspecific parasites. An important general finding is that species-level polyphyly of the mtDNA appears to be the rule in this group of ants. The existence of multiple divergent mtDNA lineages within several nominal species (including the pest S. invicta) suggests that the pattern of widespread polyphyly often stems from morphological delimitation that overcircumscribes species. However, in two cases the mtDNA polyphyly likely results from recent interspecific hybridization. While resolving species boundaries and relationships is important for understanding general patterns of diversification of South American fire ants, these issues are of added importance because invasive fire ants are emerging as global pests and becoming important model organisms for evolutionary research.

Alignment of the ITS-1 region was complicated by the presence of high levels of length polymorphism. Secondary-structure models of the ITS-I molecule are proposed which led to an improved alignment and the inclusion of some highly polymorphic sequences. The additional information obtained from the secondary-structure models can provide a justification for the exclusion of hypervariable regions from the phylogenetic analysis. The D3 region is the most conserved, ITS-I the most variable of the three gene regions investigated. Phylogenetic analyses suggest the D2 region to be most suitable not only for inferring relationships, but also for taxonomic and diagnostic purposes at species level. The ITS-I region is best suited for inferring relationships between closely related species or among populations of the same species. The combined analysis using all three regions led to a better tree and a reduced number of equally most parsimonious trees. (c) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Biologische Systematik.

Maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses showed that taxa formed two monophyletic groups, one clade comprising all species associated with Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae hosts with the exception of Chamaecyparis, and the other clade composed of species associated with Pinaceae. Species infesting Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae seemed to be specialized to particular host genera or even to be species specific, which was consistent with a taxonomic radiation following initial host adaptation. By contrast, Megastigmus species associated with Pinaceae appeared capable of shifting onto different congeneric species or even onto a new host genus, with their evolution apparently less constrained by plant association. We hypothesized that the Megastigmus group associated with Pinaceae may have a much higher invasive potential than that related to Cupressaceae.

In 1994 Shimizu proposed six subfamilies, but their validity and relationships remain inconclusive. The objective of this study was to perform a quantitative analysis of phylogenetic relationships of the Pompilidae, with emphasis on testing the validity of proposed subfamilies. Two cladistic analyses were performed based on morphological evidence. First, a maximum-parsimony analysis of Shimizu's original morphological data matrix (72 taxa by 54 characters) was conducted, with the data subjected to a heuristic search for the first time with phylogenetic software. The resulting strict-consensus cladogram yielded a monophyletic Ceropalinae that was sister group to a large polytomy containing members of the remaining five subfamilies. In a second analysis, several of Shimizu's characters were re-examined, and new characters and more taxa were added to the data set. Terminal taxa were coded as species rather than as generic abstractions, and 20 additional morphological characters were introduced. The analysis was based on 77 morphological characters derived from the adults of 84 taxa. This second analysis suggested that Notocyphinae sensu Shimizu (1994) was nested within Pompilinae and that Epipompilinae sensu Shimizu (1994) was nested within Ctenocerinae; neither should retain their status as a separate subfamily. Lastly, Chirodamus s.s., which historically has been a member of the Pepsinae, is placed within the Pompilinae with reservations rather than erecting a new subfamily. After these allowances were made, a strict consensus tree gave the following relationships: (Ceropalinae + (Pepsinae + (Ctenocerinae + Pompilinae))).},

	abstract = {The thynnine wasp genus Neozeleboria Rohwer is the main pollinating group of the sexually deceptive Australian orchid genus, Chiloglottis R.Br. In a highly specialized interaction, Chiloglottis species attract males from a single or very few Neozeleboria species through the chemical mimicry of the female wasp's sex pheromone. An earlier study examining the historical association among Chiloglottis and Neozeleboria using DNA sequence data found matching phylogenetic patterns suggestive of cospeciation between orchids and pollinators. However, patterns of constraint in Neozeleboria emergence phenology and sex pheromones suggested that the close association among orchid and wasp clades may be due to pollinator switching among closely related wasp taxa that have similar traits. In this study, we further examine the association by incorporating a morphological phylogenetic analysis of non-pollinating as well as pollinating Neozeleboria. The morphological analysis is then compared with DNA sequence data from one nuclear and one mitochondrial gene for an increased sample of outgroup genera. The combined molecular data set finds a monophyletic Neozeleboria, although support for this was not strong in the individual data sets. A high congruence between molecular and morphological analyses was found among higher groupings of Neozeleboria. Neozeleboria species that pollinate Chiloglottis species are not found as a monophyletic group but, rather, are scattered throughout a phylogeny comprising pollinators and non-pollinators. Under the cospeciation model, the presence of related Neozeleboria non-pollinators carries the unlikely implication that the association between plant and pollinator has been repeatedly lost. Instead, we favour the alternative `preferential pollinator switching' model that accounts for the specialization among orchid and wasp lineages in terms of similarities in traits among related Neozeleboria.

It is often difficult to separate morphologically similar species, and there is evidence that some species could in fact be complexes of cryptic species. Their correct identification is fundamental for biological control purposes. Recently, due to unreliability of morphological characters, molecular techniques have been investigated to identify markers that differentiate closely related species. In this study, DNA variation in an similar to 900 bp segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was examined by both sequencing and PCR-RFLP. Two pairs of species that are difficult to distinguish morphologically were analysed: Encarsia formosa Gahan and Encarsialuteola Howard, belonging to the luteola group, and two populations of Encarsiasophia (Girault \& Dodd) from Pakistan and Spain, belonging to the strenua group, recently characterized as cryptic species. High sequence divergence and species-specific restriction patterns clearly differentiate both species pairs. Parsimony analysis of the nucleotide sequences was also performed, including Encarsiahispida De Santis (luteola group) and Encarsia protransvena Viggiani (strenua group). Two monophyletic clades supporting the two groups of species considered were resolved. The results of this study support the use of the COI gene as a useful marker in separating species of Encarsia, for which morphological differences are subtle. Moreover, the COI gene appears potentially useful for understanding phylogenetic relationships in this genus.},

Mutualism stability has been hypothesized to benefit from genetic uniformity of symbionts, as multiple coexisting strains are expected to compete and, thus, reduce the benefit of the symbiosis. However, the Pseudonocardia symbionts are likely to be involved in Red-Queen-like antagonistic co-evolution with Escovopsis so that multiple strains per host might be favoured by selection provided the cost of competition between bacterial strains is low. We examined the genetic uniformity of the Pseudonocardia symbionts of two sympatric species of Acromyrmex ants by comparing partial sequences of the nuclear Elongation Factor-Tu gene. We find no genetic variation in Pseudonocardia symbionts among nest mate workers, neither in Acromyrmex octospinosus, where colonies are founded by a single queen, nor in Acromyrmex echinatior, where mixing of bacterial lineages might happen when unrelated queens cofound a colony. We further show that the two ant species maintain the same pool of Pseudonocardia symbionts, indicating that horizontal transmission occasionally occurs, and that this pool consists of two distinct clades of closely related Pseudonocardia strains. Our finding that individual colonies cultivate a single actinomycete strain is in agreement with predictions from evolutionary theory on host-symbiont conflict over symbiont mixing, but indicates that there may be constraints on the effectiveness of the bacterial symbionts on an evolutionary timescale.},

Nucleotide sequence divergence between allopatrically distributed western (A. mellifera) and eastern (A. cerana, A. koschevnikovi, A. nigrocincta, and A. nuluensis) cavity-nesting species, around 18\% for the mitochondrial gene and 10-15\% for the nuclear intron, suggested an earlier divergence for these groups than previously estimated from morphometric and behavioral studies. This latter finding neccessitates reevaluation of the hypothesized origin of extant European, African, and west Asian Apis mellifera. Sequence divergence between A. laboriosa and A. dorsata was consistent with behavioral data and supports the species status of A. laboriosa. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The monophyletic nature of almost all subfamilies, of which multiple representatives are present in this study, is well-supported except for two subfamilies, Cenocoelinae and Neoneurinae that should probably be treated as tribal rank taxa in the subfamily Euphorinae. The topology of the trees generated in the present study supported the existence of three large generally accepted lineage or groupings of subfamilies: two main entirely endoparasitic lineages of this family, referred to as the “helconoid complex” and the “microgastroid complex,” and the third “the cyclostome.” The Aphidiinae was recovered as a member of the non-cyclostomes, probably a sister group of Euphorinae or Euphorinae-complex. The basal position of the microgastroid complex among the non-cyclostomes has been found in all our analyses. The cyclostomes were resolved as a monophyletic group in all analyses if two putatively misplaced groups (Mesostoa and Aspilodemon) were excluded from them. Certain well-supported relationships evident in this family from the previous analyses were recovered, such as a sister-group relationships of Alysiinae + Opiinae, of Braconinae + Doryetinae, and a close relationship between Macrocentrinae, Xiphozelinae, Homolobinae, and Charmontinae. The relationships of “Ichneutinae + ((Adeliinae + Cheloninae) + (Miracinae + (Cardiochilinae + Microgastrinae)))” was confirmed within the microgastroid complex. The position of Acampsohelconinae, Blacinae, and Trachypetinae is problematic. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We examined the evolution of male morphology by reconstructing the phylogeny of Cardiocondyla from sequences of the mitochondrial COI/COII and 16S RNA genes from 13 of the 15 species, of which males are known. Data suggest that male polymorphism is ancestral and that winged males were lost convergently in several taxa, such as C. elegans, C batesii, and C. mauritanica. Saber-shaped mandibles and lethal fighting among adult ergatoid males might probably have been the original condition, from which strong, shear-shaped mandibles and attacks directed predominantly against freshly eclosed, not yet sclerotized males might have evolved once. The evolution of queen number from ancestral polygyny to derived monogyny appears to be associated with a switch in the behavior of ergatoid males from fighting to mutual tolerance.

	abstract = {Understanding the contribution of ecological interactions to the origin and maintenance of diversity is a fundamental challenge for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, and one that is currently receiving a great deal of attention. Natural enemies (e.g., predators, parasites, and herbivores) are ubiquitous in food webs and are predicted to have significant impacts on phenotypic diversity and on speciation, and extinction rates of their prey. Spurred by the development of a theoretical framework beginning in the late 1970s, there is now a growing body of literature that addresses the effects of enemy-prey interactions on the evolution of prey. A number of theoretical models predict that enemies can produce phenotypic divergence between closely related species, even in the absence of interspecific competition for resources. Effects on diversification of prey are more variable, and enemies may either enhance or depress speciation and extinction rates of their prey. Empirical evidences from a number of study systems, notably those involving predators and prey in aquatic environments and interactions between insects and flowering plants, confirm both predictions. There is now considerable evidence for the role of enemies, especially those that are size-selective or use visual cues when identifying suitable prey, on phenotypic divergence of sympatric and allopatric taxa. Enemies may spur diversification rates in certain groups under some circumstances, and hinder diversification rates in other cases. I suggest that further research should focus on the role of enemies in diversification of prey, with significant insights likely to be the product of applying traditional experimental approaches and emerging comparative phylogenetic methods.},

We estimated a molecular phylogeny of 15 Achrysocharoides species and compared this with host (plant and insect) phylogenies. This tri-trophic phylogenetic comparison provides no evidence for cospeciation, but parasitoids do show phylogenetic conservation of the use of plant genera. Patterns of sequence divergence also suggest that the parasitoids radiated more recently (or evolved much faster) than their insect hosts. Three main categories of brood production occur in parasitoids: (1) solitary offspring, (2) mixed sex broods and (3) separate (split) sex broods. Split sex broods are very rare and virtually restricted to Achrysocharoides, while the other types occur very widely. Our phylogeny suggests that split sex broods have evolved twice and provides evidence for a transition from solitary to mixed sex broods, via split sex broods, as predicted by theory.},

This covariation analysis yielded 36 helices that are composed of base pairs exhibiting positional covariation. Several additional regions are also involved in hydrogen bonding, and they form highly variable base-pairing patterns across the alignment. These are identified as regions of expansion and contraction or regions of slipped-strand compensation. Additionally, 31 single-stranded locales are characterized as regions of ambiguous alignment based on the difficulty in assigning positional homology in the presence of multiple adjacent indels. Based on comparative analysis of these sequences, the largest genetic study on any hymenopteran group to date, we report an annotated secondary structural model for the D2, D3 expansion segments that will prove useful in assigning positional nucleotide homology for phylogeny reconstruction in these and closely related apocritan taxa.},

AFLPs show large differences between three sub-generic clades relative to that found among species within each clade. Interspecific genetic barriers are indicated by AFLP discontinuities among species unlike in previously reported DNA sequence data. However, such barriers are demonstrated clearly in only one of the two pairs of sympatric species sampled more intensively. We interpret these patterns as indicating either (i) a rapid and recent radiation of species within each clade following histories of stasis or extinction, or (ii) alternating cycles of divergence and gene flow acting to homogenize genetic differences among species within each of the three clades.},

The phylogenetic relationships among these ants were investigated using DNA sequence data (similar to 5.2 kb from 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, wingless, abdominal-A, and long-wavelength rhodopsin genes) and 144 morphological characters, both separately and in combination. Data were gathered from a representative set of forty-nine pseudomyrmecine species, plus eighteen species from various outgroups. There was substantial agreement among the results obtained from different datasets, and from different methods of phylogenetic inference (parsimony, Bayesian inference). The monophyly of the following groups is strongly supported (100\% bootstrap support and 1.00 posterior probability in the molecular dataset): Pseudomyrmecinae, Pseudomyrmex, and Pseudomyrmex + Myrcidris. The status of the genus Tetraponera is less clear: the DNA sequence data indicate that the genus is paraphyletic, but morphological features and a unique insertion in the 28S gene support the monophyly of this taxon. Seven of nine Pseudomyrmex species groups, established previously on the basis of morphology alone, are strongly upheld, but monophyly is rejected for the P. pallens group and the P. viduus group. In the latter case, molecular evidence indicates the existence of two independent clades, associated with the ant-plants Triplaris and Tachigali, respectively, whose convergent morphological features had caused them to be placed erroneously in the same species group. The present results confirm an earlier assertion that obligate associations with domatia-bearing plants have arisen at least twelve times in the subfamily. Molecular and morphological data support the hypothesis of a sister-group relationship between Pseudomyrmecinae and Myrmeciinae (84\% parsimony bootstrap, combined dataset), which implies a Cretaceous origin of the stem-group pseudomyrmecines in the southern hemisphere. Pseudomyrmecines appear to have arisen in the Palaeotropics and later dispersed from Africa to South America, where they experienced a pronounced burst of diversification.},

Because morphological recognition of their immatures is difficult, sequencing of the mtDNA of these flies may assist with their identification. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences can also clarify evolutionary relationships. In this study, the mitochondrial genes CO1, CO2, ND4 and ND4L were sequenced for 34 species of blowflies, among which are almost all species known or suspected to breed in carrion in Australia. The resulting sequences were analysed using parsimony and maximum-likelihood Bayesian techniques. The results showed that the combination of these four genes should identify most species reliably, although some very closely related taxa could still be misdiagnosed. The data also helped clarify the life histories of Calliphora centralis Malloch, 1927, C. fuscofemorata Malloch, 1927 and C. gilesi Norris, 1994, which have hitherto only been suspected carrion breeders, and revealed that the current subgeneric assignment of taxa within Calliphora Robineau-Desvoidy, based on morphology, requires revision. Unexpectedly, both Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart, 1843) and Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann, 1830) were paraphyletic; each probably comprises two distinct species.

The species status of the latter is supported by sequence analyses of the mitochondrial CO1 and CO2 region, while analyses of the same mitochondrial region lacked resolution for the separation of C bicolor and C viatica. However, the geographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes points to different population viscosities with C bicolor queens having longer migration distances than queens of C viatica. Furthermore, by the use of microsatellites we excluded ongoing gene flow between geographically overlapping populations of C bicolor and C viatica, and hence support the morphology-based three-species hypothesis. Concerning the ongoing discussion on the future roles of morphology and molecular biology in systematics we call for a combination of both whenever possible. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

New morphometric data for nine measures of body parts and ovarian data are presented for 13 species. These are integrated with all similarly conducted available studies, giving a total of 30 species. Analysis reveals several syndromes relating reproductive and nonreproductive individuals: no meaningful distinction, physiological differences only, reproductives larger than nonreproductives with intermediate individuals present, reproductives different in shape from nonreproductives with no intermediates, and reproductives smaller in some aspects than nonreproductives. Distribution of these syndromes among species is consistent with phylogenetic relationships derived from other data. Optimizing these syndromes on the cladogram indicates that the basal condition of Epiponini is a casteless society that is not comparable to the primitively social genus Polistes where dominant queens control reproduction. Castes originate several times in Epiponini, with different results in different lineages. The best documented evolutionary sequence passes from casteless societies, to those with reproductives larger, to those with reproductives differing in shape from nonreproductives, to those with reproductives smaller in some measures. This sequence is consistent with Wheeler's theory of the origin of caste through developmental switches, and represents the most thorough test of that theory to date.},

The free-living subgenus Lasius s. str. is paraphyletic with respect to the rest of genus; the traditional “genus” Acanthomyops should be considered a part of Lasius s. lat.; free-living subgenus Cautolasius is a member of the clade of socially parasitic Lasius ants (=Chtonolasius + Acanthomyops + Austrolasius + Dendrolasius). The tree topology is congruent with two alternative scenarios of origin of the temporary social parasitism: (i) a single origin of the parasitic strategy in a derived subclade of Lasius and a secondary loss of this trait in Cautolasius, (ii) a parallel origin of the social parasitism within the clade of hypogeic Lasius ants (in Chtonolasius, and in Acanthomyops + Dendrolasius + Austrolasius). Emery's rule in the strict sense does not apply to this group because most parasites exploit any ecologically available, even phylogenetically distant host species. The parasitic strategy in Lasius could have originated from the aggressive interactions between cofounding queens during pleometric colony founding and/or from the secondary queen adoption.

We first reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of Philotrypesis associated with African figs using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. We then determine male morphotypes in the species included in our phylogeny and show that intraspecific polymorphism is common. Most species present two types of males and some species have up to three types. These morphotypes are believed to represent alternative mating tactics: some males show morphological adaptations to fighting, others are winged dispersers and others are small sneakers. Mapping out these variations onto our phylogeny reveals that the combination of morphs changes randomly along the branches of the tree. Both parsimony and likelihood approaches indicate that there has been at least one transition from dimorphism to trimorphism, several gains and losses of the small morph and two independent acquisitions of the winged morph. Using maximum likelihood analyses of character evolution, we estimate transition rates for each morph and show that the evolution of each type of morph are not correlated and that forward and backward transition rates are not significantly different. Our results altogether suggest that male morphology is evolutionary labile, it responds quickly to selection imposed by the mating environment. This study, also suggests that seemingly complex phenotypes, such as winged males, can evolve several times and can even be recreated after having been lost. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Ants are one of the most ecologically and numerically dominant families of organisms in almost every terrestrial habitat throughout the world, though they include only about 1\% of all described insect species. The development of eusociality is thought to have been a driving force in the striking diversification and dominance of this group, yet we know little about the evolution of the major lineages of ants and have been unable to clearly determine their primitive characteristics. Ants within the subfamily Amblyoponinae are specialized arthropod predators, possess many anatomically and behaviourally primitive characters and have been proposed as a possible basal lineage within the ants. We investigate the phylogenetic relationships among the members of the subfamily, using nuclear 28S rDNA sequence data. Outgroups for the analysis include members of the poneromorph and leptanillomorph (Apomyrma. Leptanilla) ant subfamilies, as well as three wasp families. Parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses provide strong support for the monophyly of a clade containing the two genera Apomyrma + Mystrium (100\% bpp; 97\% ML bs; and 97\% MP bs), and moderate support for the monophyly of the Amblyoponinae as long as Apomyrma (Apomyrminae) is included (87\% bpp; 57\% ML bs; and 76\% MP bs). Analyses did not recover evidence of monophyly of the Amblyopone genus, while the monophyly of the other genera in the subfamily is supported. Based on these results we provide a morphological diagnosis of the Amblyoponinae that includes Apomyrma. Among the outgroup taxa, Typhlomyrmex grouped consistently with Ectatomma, supporting the recent placement of Typhlomyrmex in the Ectatomminae. The results of this present study place the included ant subfamilies into roughly two clades with the basal placement of Leptanilla unclear. One clade contains all the Amblyoponinae (including Apomyrma), Ponerinae, and Proceratiinae, (Poneroid clade). The other clade contains members from subfamilies Cerapachyinae, Dolichoderinae.

We investigated the `performance' of characters from external morphology and the other character systems and the effects of abundant missing entries by comparing the data decisiveness, retention and consistency indices of four different character partitions. The results indicate that the performances of the different partitions are not related to the proportions of missing entries, but instead are negatively correlated to their proportion of informative characters, suggesting that the morphological information in this group is subject to high levels of homoplasy. The external morphological partition is significantly incongruent with respect to a data set comprising the other character systems based on the ILD test. Analyses supported neither the monophyly of the large tribes Doryctini and Hecabolini, nor the monophyly of the Spathiini and Heterospilini. Relationships obtained from successive approximation weighting analysis for the complete data differ considerably from the currently accepted tribal and subtribal classifications. The only exceptions were the Ypsistocerini and the Ecphylini, whose recognized members were recovered in single clades. A close relationship between the Binaerini and Holcobraconini, and also Monarea, is consistently supported by venom apparatus and ovipositor structure characters but is not indicated by external morphological data. Low bootstrap values obtained for most of the recovered clades in all analyses do not allow us to propose a meaningful reclassification for the group at this time.

	abstract = {Almost all of the more than 200 species of fungus-growing ants (Formicidae: Attini) cultivate litter-decomposing fungi in the family Lepiotaceae (Basidiomycota: Agaricales). The single exception to this rule is a subgroup of ant species within the lower attine genus Apterostigma, which cultivate pterulaceous fungi distantly related to the Lepiotaceae. Comparison of cultivar and ant phylogenies suggests that a switch from lepiotaceous to pterulaccous fungiculture occurred only once in the history of the fungus-growing ants. This unique switch occurred after the origin of the genus Apterostigma, such that the basal Apterostigma lineages retained the ancestral attine condition of lepiotaceous fungiculture, and none of the Apterostigma lineages in the monophyletic group of pterulaceous fungiculturists are known to have reverted back to lepiotaceous fungiculture. The origin of pterulaceous fungiculture in attine ants may have involved a unique transition from the ancestral cultivation of litter-decomposing lepiotaceous fungi to the cultivation of wood-decomposing pterulaceous fungi. Phylogenetic analyses further indicate that distantly related Apterostigma ant species sometimes cultivate the same cultivar lineage, indicating evolutionarily frequent, and possibly ongoing, exchanges of fungal cultivars between Apterostigma ant species. The pterulaceous cultivars form two sister clades, and different Apterostigma ant lineages are invariably associated with, and thus specialized on, only one of the two cultivar clades. However, within clades Apterostigma ant species are able to switch between fungi. This pattern of broad specialization by attine ants on defined cultivar clades, coupled with flexible switching between fungi within cultivar clades, is also found in other attine lineages and appears to be a general phenomenon of fungicultural evolution in all fungus-growing ants.},

	abstract = {Extreme AT bias in Hymenopteran mitochondrial genes have created difficulties for molecular phylogenetic analyses, especially for older divergences where multiple substitutions can erode signal. Heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates of different codon positions and different genes also appears to have been a major problem in resolving ancient divergences in allodapine bees. Here we examine the phylogeny of relatively recent divergences in the allodapine bee genus Braunsapis. We examined heterogeneity in nucleotide substitution parameters for one nuclear gene and codon positions in two mitochondrial genes, exploring various phylogenetic analyses for recovering relationships among species from Africa, Madagascar, southern Asia, and Australia. We explored maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, Log determinant and Bayesian analyses. Broad topological features of best fit trees tended to be similar for equivalent data sets (e.g., total, or with 3rd mt positions excluded), regardless of the analytic method used (e.g., maximum likelihood or Bayesian). Analyses that used the total data set without modelling partitions separately gave unlikely results, indicating that the Malagasy species was most closely related to Australian species. However, analyses that excluded 3rd mitochondrial positions, or modelled partitions separately, suggested that the Malagasy species falls within the African clade. The unlikely topologies apparently result from long branch attraction, and this problem is ameliorated where modelling allows more realistic estimates of base composition and evolutionary rates for 3rd mitochondrial positions. However, we found that even when codon positions are modelled separately, estimated evolutionary rates for 3rd mitochondrial positions are likely to underestimate true rates. Long branch attraction and multiple substitutions are likely to be much more difficult to circumvent in analyses that explore older, generic-level, divergences in allodapine bees where overwriting is expected to be much more extreme. Our results indicate an African origin for Braunsapis, followed by a single, very early, dispersal event into Asia and then by a later dispersal event into Australia. The Malagasy species is derived from within the African clade. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The phylogeny based on a 2051 bp fragment of mtDNA including cyt b, tRNA(Ser), and ND1 genes supports the division of the group into three major clusters: one with the species F polyctena and F rufa, one with F aquilonia, F lugubris, and F paralugubris, and the third one with F pratensis. The interspecific divergence estimates (mean 0.98 +/- 0.15\% for the main phylogenetic groups) imply that radiation took place during the Pleistocene. Comparison of the divergence estimates among the F rufa group species with divergence estimates among other closely related species of insects suggests that speciation in the group was relatively fast, and the mitochondrial lineages of F polyctena and F rufa have not fully separated. The haplotype tree shows also signs of transfer of mtDNA between species through hybridisation. The distribution of polygyny (multiple queens per nest) along the branches of the tree indicates that the social type characterised by highly polygynous societies and large colonial networks, has originated at least three times. The species F aquilonia and F paralugubris that build such large supercolonies, cluster tightly together with very little nucleotide variation, suggesting that this type of social organisation could be a factor promoting speciation in the ants.

Although diversity of the ITS2 sequence is high, these data can still be a potential tool for primary analysis of molecular phylogeny and biogeography of Strumigenys at the species level on islands around Taiwan.

We tested for genetic differentiation of the above isolates by sequencing portions of the COI and 16S mtDNA genes. We also examined a Florida isolate reared from Toxoptera citricida (Kirkaldy) and L. fabarum Marshall as an outgroup. The Great Plains isolates (Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas) were homogeneous with 0\% and 0-0.2\% sequence divergence in the COI and 16S gene fragments, respectively.

	abstract = {In order to reconstruct ants' phylogeny, we analysed DNA sequences for two nuclear genes, abdominal-A and Ultrabithorax, from 49 species of ants and two outgroups. As these genes control the development of the first segments of the abdomen in insects, which are very variable in ants (petiole, postpetiole, and gaster constriction), we hypothesized that the morphological variations between the subfamilies may be correlated with mutations of some abd-A or Ubx regions. Contrarily to our hypothesis, these sequences are highly conserved. The differences observed concern mainly third codon positions and present some saturation. Phylogenetic reconstructions were carried out using the genetic raw sequence data and by combining them with a set of morphological data (Total Evidence). Relations among subfamilies of ants remains poorly resolved with molecular data only, but adding these data to morphological characters confirms and reinforce the topology of Baroni Urbani et al. (1992): a Poneroid complex [Ponerinae, Cerapachyinae, Leptanillinae and army ants], a Formicoid complex [Dolichoderinae, Formicinae] and a Myrmecoid complex [Myrmicinae, Myrmeciinae, Pseudomyrmecinae, Nothomyrmeciinae]. Our molecular results allow resolution near the branch tips and three subfamilies (Dolichoderinae, Formicinae and Pseudomyrmecinae) always appear as monophyletic. The Formicinae and the Dolichoderinae have close relationships. The Camponotini appear as a strong clade inside the Formicinae. The Ponerinae are separated in two parts: the Ectatommini and all other tribes. The Cerapachyinae, Dorylinae, and Ecitoninae belong to the same clade, the Cerapachyinae being confirmed in their subfamily status. The Myrmicinae appears to be very heterogeneous, with the Attini forming a very stable and well-separated group. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Results showed that the monophyly of subtribes of Rhingiini remained ambiguous, especially due to unstable phylogenetic placements of the genera Portevinia and Rhingia.

We included 58 species of halictid bees from 33 genera, representing all subfamilies and tribes, and rooted the trees using seven outgroups from other bee families: Colletidae, Andrenidae, Melittidae, and Apidae. We analyzed the separate and combined data sets by a variety of methods, including equal weights parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Analysis of the combined data set produced a strong phylogenetic signal with high bootstrap and Bremer support and high posterior probability well into the base of the tree. The phylogeny recovered the monophyly of the Halictidae and of all four subfamilies and both tribes, recovered relationships among the subfamilies and tribes congruent with morphology, and provided robust support for the relationships among the numerous genera in the tribe Halictini, sensu Michener (2000). Using our combined nucleotide data set, several recently described halictid fossils from the Oligocene and Eocene, and recently developed Bayesian methods, we estimated the antiquity of major clades within the family. Our results indicate that each of the four subfamilies arose well before the Cretaceous - Tertiary boundary and suggest that the early radiation of halictid bees involved substantial African - South American interchange roughly coincident with the separation of these two continents in the late Cretaceous. This combination of single-copy nuclear genes is capable of recovering Cretaceous-age divergences in bees with high levels of support. We propose that LWopsin, wingless, and EF-1alpha (F2 copy) may be useful in resolving relationships among bee families and other Cretaceous-age insect lineages.},

We used nuclear DNA microsatellite flanking sequences, mitochondrial COI sequence, and morphological characters to generate a phylogeny for the Polistinae (Hymenoptera) using 69 species. Results: Our phylogeny is largely concordant with previous phylogenies at higher levels, and is more resolved at the species level. Our results support the monophyly of the New World subgenera of Polistini, while the Old World subgenera are a paraphyletic group. All genera for which we had more than one exemplar were supported as monophyletic except Polybia which is not resolved, and may be paraphyletic. Conclusion: The combination of DNA sequences from flanks of microsatellite repeats with mtCOI sequences and morphological characters proved to be useful characters establishing relationships among the different subgenera and species of the Polistini.

The results suggest multiple gains of active pollination in fig wasps, but are sensitive to assumptions about the relative costs of gaining and losing this complex behaviour. In addition, previous comparative studies at higher taxonomic levels have reported correlated evolution between active pollination in wasps and low anther/ovule ratios in figs.

The morphological and ecological data were combined in a single character matrix and analyzed separately from the molecular data, resulting in an eco-morphological cladogram and a molecular cladogram. Attributes of galls and host associations were superimposed on the molecular cladogram in order to detect possible trends in the evolution of these traits. The cladograms resulting from the two independent analyses were statistically incongruent, although both provide evidence for the monophyly of the genera Baldratia and Careopalpis and the paraphyly of the genera Stefaniola and Izeniola. The results suggest a minor impact of the morphological characters traditionally used in the classification of the Baldratiina, whereas ecological data had a major impact on the phylogenetic inference. Mapping of gall and host attributes on the molecular cladogram suggests that multi-chambered stem galls constitute the ancestral state in the subtribe, with several subsequent shifts to leaf galls. It is concluded that in contrast to other studied groups of gall insects, related baldratiine species induce different types of galls, attesting to speciation driven by gall-type shifts at least as often as host shifts.

We analyzed sequence data of 33 species representing the taxa Cleptinae, Elampini, Parnopini, and Chrysidini. Most of the currently recognized relationships of major cuckoo wasp lineages are supported by the molecular data. A key difference concerns the phylogenetic position of the Euchroeus (= Brugmoia) group within the tribe Chrysidini. It seems likely that an erroneous interpretation of morphological characters has led to inappropriate rooting of that tribe. We suggest that species of the Euchroeus group be interpreted as forming the stem group of the Chrysidini and that the remaining genera of that tribe be united in a subordinated taxon. Our results imply that the evolution of anal dentition, of significance for breaking into sealed host nests otherwise not accessible to cuckoo wasps, already happened at the base of the Chrysidini and that an even number of anal teeth arose prior to an odd number.

	abstract = {We analyzed 12 combined mitochondrial and nuclear gene datasets in seven orders of insects using both equal weights parsimony (to evaluate phylogenetic utility) and Bayesian methods (to investigate substitution patterns). For the Bayesian analyses we used relatively complex models.(e.g., general time reversible models with rate variation) that allowed us to quantitatively compare relative rates among genes and codon positions, patterns of rate variation among genes, and substitution patterns within genes. Our analyses indicate that nuclear and mitochondrial genes differ in a number of important ways, some of which are correlated with phylogenetic utility. First and most obviously, nuclear genes generally evolve more slowly than mitochondrial genes (except in one case), making them better markers for deep divergences. Second, nuclear genes showed universally high values of CI and (generally) contribute more to overall tree resolution than mitochondrial genes (as measured by partitioned Bremer support). Third, nuclear genes show more homogeneous patterns of among-site rate variation (higher values of alpha than mitochondrial genes). Finally, nuclear genes show more symmetrical transformation rate matrices than mitochondrial genes. The combination of low values of alpha and highly asymmetrical transformation rate matrices may explain the overall poor performance of mitochondrial genes when compared to nuclear genes in the same analysis. Our analyses indicate that some parameters are highly correlated. For example, A/T bias was positively and significantly associated with relative rate and CI was positively and significantly associated with alpha (the shape of the gamma distribution). These results provide important insights into the substitution patterns that might characterized high quality genes for phylogenetic analysis: high values of a, unbiased base composition, and symmetrical transformation rate matrices. We argue that insect molecular systematists should increasingly focus on nuclear rather than mitochondrial gene datasets because nuclear genes do not suffer from the same substitutional biases that characterize mitochondrial genes.

	abstract = {The recent development of Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo( MCMC) techniques has facilitated the exploration of parameter-rich evolutionary models. At the same time, stochastic models have become more realistic ( and complex) and have been extended to new types of data, such as morphology. Based on this foundation, we developed a Bayesian MCMC approach to the analysis of combined data sets and explored its utility in inferring relationships among gall wasps based on data from morphology and four genes ( nuclear and mitochondrial, ribosomal and protein coding). Examined models range in complexity from those recognizing only a morphological and a molecular partition to those having complex substitution models with independent parameters for each gene. Bayesian MCMC analysis deals efficiently with complex models: convergence occurs faster and more predictably for complex models, mixing is adequate for all parameters even under very complex models, and the parameter update cycle is virtually unaffected by model partitioning across sites. Morphology contributed only 5\% of the characters in the data set but nevertheless influenced the combined-data tree, supporting the utility of morphological data in multigene analyses. We used Bayesian criteria ( Bayes factors) to show that process heterogeneity across data partitions is a significant model component, although not as important as among-site rate variation. More complex evolutionary models are associated with more topological uncertainty and less conflict between morphology and molecules. Bayes factors sometimes favor simpler models over considerably more parameter-rich models, but the best model overall is also the most complex and Bayes factors do not support exclusion of apparently weak parameters from this model. Thus, Bayes factors appear to be useful for selecting among complex models, but it is still unclear whether their use strikes a reasonable balance between model complexity and error in parameter estimates.},

Candidatus Blochmannia gen. nov. ( Blochmannia) is an obligate bacterial associate of Camponotus and related ant genera ( Hymenoptera: Formicidae). The occurrence of Blochmannia in all Camponotus species sampled from field populations and its maternal transmission to host offspring suggest that this bacterium is engaged in a long-term, stable association with its ant hosts. However, evidence for cospeciation in this system is equivocal because previous phylogenetic studies were based on limited gene sampling, lacked statistical analysis of congruence, and have even suggested host switching. We compared phylogenies of host genes ( the nuclear EF-1alphaF2 and mitochondrial COI/II) and Blochmannia genes (16S ribosomalDNA[ rDNA], groEL, gidA, and rpsB), totaling more than 7 kilobases for each of 16 Camponotus species. Each data set was analyzed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction methods. We found minimal conflict among host and symbiont phylogenies, and the few areas of discordance occurred at deep nodes that were poorly supported by individual data sets. Concatenated protein-coding genes produced a very well-resolved tree that, based on the Shimodaira - Hasegawa test, did not conflict with any host or symbiont data set. Correlated rates of synonymous substitution (d(S)) along corresponding branches of host and symbiont phylogenies further supported the hypothesis of cospeciation. These findings indicate that Blochmannia - Camponotus symbiosis has been evolutionarily stable throughout tens of millions of years. Based on inferred divergence times among the ant hosts, we estimated rates of sequence evolution of Blochmannia to be similar to0.0024 substitutions per site per million years (s/s/MY) for the 16S rDNA gene and similar to 0.1094 s/s/MY at synonymous positions of the genes sampled. These rates are several-fold higher than those for related bacteria Buchnera aphidicola and Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic congruence among Blochmannia genes indicates genome stability that typifies primary endosymbionts of insects.},

Fig relationships based on the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and pollinator relationships inferred from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences enabled the study of correlated evolution based on molecular phylogenies for the largest set of interacting species ever compared. Comparative methods have been applied to tests of adaptation, but the application of these methods in tests of coadaptation, defined as reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting lineages, has received less attention. I have extended tests of correlated evolution between two traits along a phylogeny to the case of interacting lineages, where two traits may or may not share a common phylogenetic history. Independent contrasts and phylogenetic autocorrelation rejected the null hypothesis that trait correlations within lineages are stronger than trait correlations between interacting lineages. Fig style lengths and pollinator ovipositor lengths, for example, were more highly correlated than were pollinator body size and ovipositor length. Mutualistic interactions between figs and their pollinators illustrate the novel ways in which phylogenies and comparative methods can detect patterns of correlated evolution. The most outstanding evidence of correlated evolution between these obligate mutualists is that interacting trait correlations are stronger than within-lineage allometric relationships.},

	abstract = {Primitively eusocial insect are often considered particularly useful for investigations into the processes underlying the origins of eusociality. Ceratinine bees have long been regarded as solitary, but sometimes exhibit oddly social traits for solitary species, while other species are known to be social, and social behaviour has been artificially induced in others still (Maeta Sakagami 1995; Sakagami \& Maeta 1995). Recent studies have had some success in elucidating aspects of the evolution of social behaviour in some groups using phylogenetics to infer historical changes in social behaviour (eg: Danforth 2002; Schwarz et al. 2003; Bull et al. 2003). Phylogenetic treatments of Ceratina have only recently been attempted in earnest (Terzo 2000) and behavioural data is lacking for many Ceratina species. Nonetheless, the Japanese fauna represents some of the most comprehensively studied Ceratina, and this study uses nucleotide data from mitochondrial COI and CytB and nuclear EF-1alpha regions to infer a phylogeny of Japanese Ceratina species. Data give good resolution for the subgeneric groups, and provide some support for the recent morphological phylogeny of Terzo (2000), but little resolution for higher relationships. Behavioural data suggest that sociality is variable within subgenera. The diversity and primitive nature of social behaviour in this group make it one of the most promising to provide insights into the process of social evolution, but more data are clearly needed.},

The five haplotypes of L. austriacus do not cluster according to their geographic origin, indicating a recent gene flow among the populations. The molecular data corroborate the morphology based hypothesis that L. austriacus belongs to the Lasius (Lasius s.str.) brunneus group. The invasive species Lasius neglectus forms a sister taxon with L. turcicus, both next related to L. austriacus. Other phylogenetic relationships within the genus Lasius are in accordance with morphological data. First data on the bionomics of L. austriacus are discussed in context with its phylogenetic position. Based on gyne and male morphology, excavations of nests, pitfall trapping and observations in formicaries, we hypothesize that L. austriacus is a mainly hypogaeic, monogynous species with nuptial flight. These are characters of the Lasius brunneus group in general, except the polygynous-polycalic, intranidally copulating L. neglectus. Aggression tests, however, revealed nonaggressive behaviour (antennation) between separated L. austriacus populations, but pronounced interspecific aggression against L. neglectus. This confirms the species status of L. austriacus and indicates a reduced level of intraspecific aggression, similar to L. neglectus. The status of L. austriacus as a native species in Central Europe is confirmed.},

	abstract = {Emery's rule predicts that social parasites and their host; share common ancestry and are therefore likely to be close relatives. Within the leaf-cutting ant genus Acromyrmex, two taxa of social parasites have been found, which are thought to occupy opposite grades of permanent social parasitism, based on their contrasting morphologies: Acromyrtnex insinuator differs little in morphology from its free-living congeneric host species and produces a worker caste, and is thus thought to represent an early grade of social parasitism. At the other extreme, Pseudoatta spp. exhibit a very specialised morphology and lack a worker caste, both of which are characteristics of an evolutionarily derived grade of social parasitism. Here we present a molecular phylogeny using partial sequences of cytochrome oxidase I and II of about half of the known Acromyrtnex species including two social parasites, their hosts and all congeneric species occurring sympatrically. We show that the two inquiline parasites represent two separate origins of social parasitism in the genus Acromyrmex. The early-grade social parasite A. insinuator is highly likely to be the sister species of its host Acromyrmex echinator, but the derived social parasite Pseudoatta sp. is not the sister species of its extant host Acromyrmex rugosus.},

These trees indicated that the ant subfamilies were clustered singly, and, among the seven subfamilies examined, Ponerinae and six other subfamilies are in a sistergroups relationship. The relationship among the six subfamilies, however, was not clarified. The phylogenetic trees constructed in the present study are not in contradiction to the tree from cladistic analysis of morphological data by Baroni Urbani et al.

The present results thus raise a question as to the status of some traditionally employed “key” morphological characters.

We detected Wolbachia in four of 11 native populations, but only one of 21 introduced populations was infected. In the Argentine ant's native range, the distribution of Wolbachia supergroups A and B was nonoverlapping. By coupling infection frequency data with behaviourally defined colony boundaries, we show that infected and uninfected colonies are often adjacent to one another, supporting the proposition that little female-mediated gene flow occurs among Argentine ant colonies. We also conduct a phylogenetic analysis, and show that the Wolbachia infecting both native and introduced populations of Argentine ants belong to two lineages that appear to be specialized on infecting New World ants. One other lineage of Wolbachia has undergone frequent, recent episodes of horizontal transmission between distantly related, introduced insect hosts.},

Sequence data from nuclear 28S rRNA and mitochondrial COI genes in conjunction with larval and adult morphological characters of fifty-one syrphid taxa were analysed using optimization alignment to explore phylogenetic relationships among included taxa. A species of Platypezidae, Agathomyia unicolor, was used as outgroup, and also including one representative (Jassidophaga villosa) of the sister-group of Syrphidae, Pipunculidae. Sensitivity of the data was assessed under six different parameter values. A stability tree summarized the results. Microdontini, including Spheginobaccha, was placed basally, and Pipizini appeared as the sister-group to subfamily Syrphinae. The monophyly of subfamily Eristalinae was supported. The results support at least two independent origins of entomophagy in syrphids, and frequent shifts between larval feeding habitats within the saprophagous eristalines.},

The incorporation of four characters associated with gall morphology is explored, although only a single parsimony-informative gall character is obtained. All analyses retrieve Diastrophus as paraphyletic with respect to the monotypic genus Gonaspis. These two genera share several morphological synapomorphies as well as related host plant associations. The genus Gonaspis is thus a new junior synonym of Diastrophus, and Gonaspis potentillae is herein transferred to Diastrophus as D. potentillae Bassett. In addition, D. kincaidii var. austrior Kinsey is formally elevated to specific status, as Diastrophus austrior Kinsey (new status). Association of Diastrophus species with Rubus, as well as with woody host plants, could have originated once, but the possibility of more than one origination cannot be excluded. In either case, at least two reversal events have contributed to the patterns of association of Diastrophus with Potentilla, and with herbaceous host plants. Reconstruction of the historical biogeography of the group using a dispersal and vicariance analysis model suggests that the ancestor of Diastrophus was either East Nearctic (EN) or Holarctic. The two West Palearctic (WP) species resulted from either two independent dispersals from EN followed by subsequent vicariance, or from a basal vicariance between WP and EN and a subsequent dispersal from EN to WP followed by a subsequent vicariance between the two regions. The West Nearctic species resulted from dispersals from EN and are relatively recent.},

Our results supported the validity of our currently used morphospecies concept for Peninsula Malaysia. However, on a wider geographic range (including North and North-East Borneo) some morphospecies turned out to be species complexes with genetically quite distinct taxa. Our phylogenetic analysis and host association studies do not indicate strict cocladogenesis between the subgenus Decacrema and their Macaranga host-plants because multiple ant taxa occur on quite distinct host-plants belonging to different clades within in the genus Macaranga. These results support the view that host-shifting or host-expansion is common in the ants colonizing Macaranga.

	abstract = {Endosymbionts are being discovered in unprecedented numbers of invertebrate species. The bacterium Wolbachia pipientis alone is carried by some 20\% of all insect species, in which it is responsible for such reproductive manipulations as cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminization of genetic males, male-killing and parthenogenesis. The discovery of Wolbachia-induced thelytoky in hymenopteran parasitoids has initiated the successful search in other groups of haplodiploid species. Haplodiploidy has arisen at least 17 times during animal evolution and intracellular bacteria that effect sexual development have been found in many of these haplodiploid groups, rekindling the question regarding the origin of haplodiploidy. The detection of Wolbachia in parthenogenetic thrips (Thysanoptera), booklice (Psocoptera), springtails (Collembola), mites (Acari) and Xiphinematobacter in dragger nematodes (Dorylaimida) raises the possibility of bacterial-induced parthenogenesis in diplodiploid species as well. Recent studies indicate that Wolbachia might be just one of a rapidly increasing list of intracellular bacteria capable of inducing parthenogenesis in their host. The search for novel endosymbionts will rely heavily on previous taxonomic work, but the possibilities for discovery remain boundless. (C) 2003 The Linnean Society of London.},

	abstract = {Allodapine bees are most diverse in Africa but are distributed throughout the Old World tropical and Austral regions. They are considered useful for studies into the evolution of social behaviour since they exhibit the full range of social organisation from solitary to highly eusocial (sensu Michener, 1974; Wilson, 1971). Five genera are found in,Australia, namely Braunsapis, Exoneurella, Exoneura, Brevineura, and Inquilina. Sociality and life histories are well documented for the exoneurine genera (review in Schwarz et al., 1998) and Inquilina is an obligate social parasite of species of Exoneura (Michener, 1965). In this paper, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods using molecular sequence data from two mitochondrial gene regions (cyt b and COI) and a single nuclear gene region (EF-1alpha) are used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of the Australian allodapine genera. Results suggest that the exoneurine group (Brevineura, Exoneurella, and Exoneura + Inquilina) diverged very rapidly and are monophyletic to the exclusion of other (primarily African) allodapine genera. A clade containing Australian species of Braunsapis is also monophyletic to the exclusion of African congeners. Braunsapis is not phylogenetically close to, and is a more derived group than the exoneurine group and probably came to occupy the Australian plate via a later dispersal through the southern Asian region. It is unclear at this point how the exoneurine group came to occupy the Australian plate and possible scenarios are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

The number of ovarioles is 6 (3 per ovary) in most sphecids (including pseudoparasitoids), but 4 in most Oxybelus, and 8 in all cleptoparasites. It is hypothesized that the reduced number of ovarioles in Oxbelus is an adaptation to their pre carrying mechanism (transporting the prey impaled on the sting), The increased number of ovarioles in cleptoparasites probably increases the number of eggs that a female can deposit. both during tier lifetime and within a given short time period, This is probably an adaptation to the patiotemporally limited resource of suitable host nests. The number of mature oocytes increases from nonparasitic to cleptoparasitic to pseudoparasitoid species. Also, parasitic sphecids tend to ha c smaller oocytes than nonparasitic species. which. however, is only, ambiguously corroborated by the present study. Our observations agree well with the literature data. and remarkable similarities in the general pattern in ovariole and oocyte numbers could be detected, which were explained accordingly as adaptations to parental investment strategies.},

However, their analyses also showed the Vespidae as paraphyletic in terms of the bee family Apidae. Simultaneous analysis of these molecular data with published morphological and behavioral characters is presented. The resulting cladograms support monophyly of Vespidae, as well as monophyly of social wasps, with the primitively social Stenogastrinae being more closely related to the highly social Polistinae + Vespinae than the solitary Eumeninae. A realignment of the sequence data is also presented, which is more parsimonious than that published by Schmitz and Moritz.

We used a phylogeographical approach to identify the region of endemism and determine the geographical origin of world populations of the seed-feeding wasp Megastigmus transvaalensis (Hussey). This wasp feeds on African Rhus species and South American Schinus species in various locations around the world. Because it is present both in Africa and in South America, it is unclear whether the wasp was originally an African Rhus -feeder that has begun feeding on Schinus or a South American Schinus -feeder that has started feeding on Rhus . Phylogenetic analysis of 800 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequence data found extensive variation and phylogeographical structure within African M. transvaalensis . Specimens from other locations around the world were all identical in COI sequence and were phylogenetically nested within the African samples. We conclude that M. transvaalensis was originally an African Rhus -feeder that readily attacks Schinus . We evaluate potential pathways of introduction of this wasp to the New World, and we discuss implications of our results for biocontrol efforts against invasive Schinus populations.},

The entire data set consisted of 3,421 aligned nucleotide sites, 854 of which were parsimony informative. Analyses by equal weights parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods yielded good resolution among the 53 taxa/populations, with strong bootstrap support and high posterior probabilities for most nodes. There was no significant incongruence among genes, and parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods yielded congruent results. We mapped social behavior onto the resulting tree for 42 of the taxa/populations to infer the likely history of social evolution within Lasioglossum. Our results indicate that eusociality had a single origin within Lasioglossum. Within the predominantly eusocial clade, however, there have been multiple (six) reversals from eusociality to solitary nesting, social polymorphism, or social parasitism, suggesting that these reversals may be more common in primitively eusocial Hymenoptera than previously anticipated. Our results support the view that eusociality is hard to evolve but easily lost. This conclusion is potentially important for understanding the early evolution of the advanced eusocial insects, such as ants, termites, and corbiculate bees.},

Comparisons of a select group of basal formicid and isopteran taxa suggest that the reproductive organization of colonies and their patterns of division of labor were particularly influenced, in both groups, by nesting and feeding ecology. Opportunities for serial inheritance of the nest structure and colony population by kin may have been significant in the evolution of multiple reproductive forms and options. Disease has been a significant factor in the evolution of social organization in ants and termites, but the adaptive mechanisms of infection control differ.

Melipona manducaia is a member of Group I Melipona. Treatment with DraI/Giemsa discloses a larger number of bands than treatment with DraI/QM. Pre-cleavage with DraI gave rise to a larger number of bands following QM staining; a circumstance evidently due to a removal of the DNA-protein complex that prevented the association of the fluorochrome with AT-rich DNA. The results highlight the complex nature of heterochromatin.},

Of the four Asian Dorylinae, Dorylus (Dichtha-dia) laevigatus was believed to be the only species occurring on Borneo, sharing its habitat only with Aenictus and Lep-togenys army ants and mass raiding Pheidologeton species. Using palm oil baits, we monitored the hypogaeic movements of D. laevigatus in Sabah (Malaysia, Borneo) and found a second species, i.e. D. cf. vishnui, also recruiting to the baits. To characterize the new species and differentiate it from D. laevigatus, we compared nine morphological traits. Hind tibia length, petiole shape, and number of antennal segments showed to differ significantly. Both species foraged predominately hypogaeicly and were found in similar habitats and altitudes. However, differences were found in bait utilization and foraging strategy. Furthermore, D. cf. vishnui seemed more likely to come to the soil surface than D. laevigatus. A phylogenetic analysis based on 385 basepairs of mtDNA confirmed the distinctiveness of both species. Interestingly, D. laevigatus showed considerable intraspecific differences between subpopulations from Java, West Malaysia, and even within Borneo, which might indicate that D. laevigatus is a species complex containing multiple cryptic species. A single male, collected from a light trap in Sabah, could be assigned to D. laevigatus using the same phylogeny, confirming this previously only assumed association. Encounters between the two species were observed at 11 baits, leading in ten cases to fierce fights. We provide the first detailed description of such interspecific fights, in which major workers were the fighters in both species. Experiments with intra- and interspecific mixing of workers in the laboratory showed D. laevigatus to have a higher aggressive level towards D. cf. vishnui than towards foreign conspecific colonies. No intraspecific fights between neighboring D. laevigatus colonies were observed in the field.},

Phylogenetic relationships within oak gallwasps remain to be established, while sexual and parthenogenetic generations of many species remain unpaired. Previous work on oak gallwasps has revealed substantial intra-specific variation, particularly between regions known to represent discrete Pleistocene glacial refuges. Here we use statistical phylogenetic inference methods on sequence data for a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to reconstruct the relationships among 62 oak gallwasp species. For 16 of these we also include 23 additional cytochrome b haplotype sequences from different Pleistocene refuge areas to test the effect of intra-specific variation on inter-specific phylogeny reconstruction. The reconstructed phylogenies show good intra-generic resolution and identify several conserved clades, but fail to reconstruct either very recent or very ancient divergences. Nine of the 16 species represented by multiple haplotypes are not monophyletic. The apparent discordance between the recovered gene tree and the current taxonomic classification can be explained through: (a) collapsing of some species currently known only from either a sexual or a parthenogenetic generation into a single cyclically parthenogenetic entity; (b) sorting of ancestral polymorphism in diverging lineages, and (c) horizontal transfer of haplotypes, perhaps due to hybridization within glacial refuges. Our conclusions emphasise the need for careful intra-specific sampling when reconstructing phylogenies for radiations of closely related species and imply that for certain taxonomic groups full phylogenetic resolution (using molecular markers) may not be attainable.

Tetrapedia pluricincta Vachal, 1909, previously considered a species of Caenonomada, is transferred to the genus Monoeca Lepeletier \& Serville, 1828. An identification key and illustrations are provided. Phylogenetic analysis based on morphological characters of adult specimens supported only one hypothesis of relationship among the species: ((C. bruneri + C. labrata sp. nov) C. unicalcarata). The resulting area cladogram implies two vicariance events, followed by dispersal of C. unicalcarata from northeastern Brazil to the arid regions of northern Argentina. The historical relationship between the areas, as indicated by the present study, is different from that obtained by other authors who studied forest associated organisms. It is postulated that this divergence is due to the fact that the historical hypotheses refer to different ancestral biotas, one associated with xeric habitats and the other associated with forest habitats.},

	abstract = {Eusocial paper wasps, yellowjackets, and hornets (Vespidae) exhibit two modes of colony foundation, primitively eusocial independent founders and advanced eusocial swarm founders. Unlike independent founders, swarm-founding wasps require a means of social communication to coordinate the movement of colony members between nest sites. We employed a phylogeny of paper wasps, yellowjackets, and hornets to test for patterns of correlated evolution between the mode of colony foundation and the presence of sternal exocrine glands. We also reviewed data on worker actions during swarming to determine whether swarm communication behavior was dependent upon gland possession and whether communicative behavior was shared among swarm-founding species. We did not find evidence for an association of sternal glands with swarm founding. Although sternal gland presence differed among swarm-founding species, worker behavior during swarming showed little variation. Workers of nearly all swarm-founding species rub their gasters on objects along swarm routes, independently of the occurrence of sternal glands. Widespread gastral rubbing indicates the use of swarm emigration trail pheromones from a diversity of glandular sources. Transitions from independent to swarm founding have been achieved via diverse pheromonal mechanisms in the Vespidae, while worker communicative behavior is either highly conserved or convergent.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships of the suprageneric groups of the ichneumonid subfamily Pimplinae (Hymenoptera) are re-assessed using 166 morphological and biological characters for 162 species, representing all of the available described genera and subgenera. The cladistic analysis was repeated using abstracted genera, re-coded from the initial set of species, as terminal taxa. The topology of the resulting cladograms was similar. In the first (primary) analysis several genera (including Neotheronia, Itoplectis, Dolichomitus, Dreisbachia, Polysphincta, Oxyrrhexis and Zonopimpla) were not retrieved as monophyletic groups; however, all except the last were found to be monophyletic in the second analysis. These results suggest that using abstracted taxa may force a `false monophyly' on the preselected groups. Thus we reject the use of such abstractions, preferring instead to use exemplar species that together show much of the variation that occurs within a hypothesized genus. Within the Pimplinae three major groupings were recognized, the Delomeristini (including the Perithoini syn. nov.), the Pimplini and the Ephialtini. Within the Pimplini, two generic groups were recovered, the Xanthopimpla and Pimpla genus-groups, but a third postulated group, the Theronia genus-group, was found to be paraphyletic. Within the Ephialtini five groups were recognized, the Pseudopimpla, Alophosternum, Camptotypus, Ephialtes and Sericopimpla genus-groups. The spider parasitizing complex of genera (the Polysphincta genus-complex) was found to nest within the Sericopimpla genus-group confirming the placement of Polysphinctini as a synonym of Ephialtini. Problems with the status of some existing genera are highlighted, but formal nomenclatural changes are not proposed. The ancestral Pimplinae are hypothesized to have been solitary ectoparasitic idiobionts on weakly concealed immature Hymenoptera. The major radiations within the Pimplinae are shown as: (1) a progressive exploitation of cocooned, then weakly cocooned, lepidopterous pupae in the Pimplini leading to idiobiont endoparasitism; (2) increasing specialization to attack hosts deeply concealed in wood in the Ephialtes genus-group, and (3) specialization on a variety of cocooned hosts, including spider egg sacs, leading to koinobiont ectoparasitism of spiders. A brief synopsis of the distribution of the group is given, and some biogeographical inferences drawn. The group is presumed to have originated and radiated on Laurasia; no evidence for trans-Antarctic relationships can be found. (C) 2002 The Linnean Society of London.},

However, behavioural information can be extrapolated from end-products only if there is congruence between the end-product structure and the animal's movements. Case building behaviour was studied in caddisflies (Trichoptera) to examine the relationship between end-products and behaviour. We found examples of taxa that built similar structures using different behavioural patterns, and taxa that built different structures using similar behaviours, regardless of whether these taxa were closely or distantly related. These findings question the reliability of behavioural inferences based solely on details of their associated end-products and suggest that end-product structure should be removed from the definition of animal behaviour.},

In addition, the host populations unexpectedly were found to be polyphyletic. Populations of Pogonomyrmex rugosus from an area east of the Chiricahua Mountains in Southern Arizona belong to a mitochondrial clade separate from the more western clade of P. rugosus from the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.

	abstract = {Wolbachia bacteria infect approximate to 20\% of all insect species, and cause a range of alterations to host reproduction, including imposition of thelytoky. The incidence and phenotypic impact of Wolbachia remains to be established in many insect taxa, and considerable research effort is currently focused on its association with particular reproductive modes and the relative importance of the various pathways via which infection occurs. Gallwasps represent an attractive system for addressing these issues for two reasons. First, they show a diversity of reproductive modes (including arrhenotoky, thelytoky and cyclical parthenogenesis) in which the impact of Wolbachia infection can be examined. Second, they occupy two intimately linked trophic niches (gall-inducers and inquilines) between which there is potential for the horizontal exchange of Wolbachia infection. In the arrhenotokous gallwasp lineages screened to date (the herb-galling `Aylacini' and the rose-galling Diplolepidini), Wolbachia infection always induces thelytoky. The impact of Wolbachia in other arrhenotokous clades, and in the cyclically parthenogenetic clades remains unknown. Here we use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening and sequence data for two Wolbachia genes (wsp and ftsZ ) to examine the prevalence and incidence of Wolbachia infection in 64 species (a total of 609 individuals) in two further tribes: the arrhenotokous inquilines (tribe Synergini), and the cyclically parthenogenetic oak gallwasps (tribe Cynipini). We ask: (i) whether Wolbachia infection has any apparent impact on host reproduction in the two tribes and (ii) whether there is any correlation between Wolbachia infection and the apparent lack of an arrhenotokous generation in many oak gallwasp life cycles. We show: (i) that Wolbachia infection is rare in the Cynipini. Infected species show no deviation from cyclical parthenogenesis, and infection is no more common in species known only from a thelytokous generation; (ii) that there is a higher incidence of infection within the arrhenotokous inquilines, and generally in gallwasp tribes without cyclical parthenogensis; (iii) all Wolbachia -positive inquiline species are known to possess males, implying either that Wolbachia infection does not result in loss of sex in this tribe or, more probably, that (as for some rose gallwasps) Wolbachia infection leads to loss of sex in specific populations; and (iv) although we find some inquilines and gall inducers to be infected with Wolbachia having the same wsp sequence, these hosts are not members of the same gall communities, arguing against frequent horizontal transmission between these two trophic groups. We suggest that exchange may be mediated by the generalist parasitoids common in oak galls.},

	abstract = {Obligate mating of females (queens) with multiple males has evolved only rarely in social Hymenoptera (ants, social bees, social wasps) and for reasons that are fundamentally different from those underlying multiple mating in other animals. The monophyletic tribe of ('attine') fungus-growing ants is known to include evolutionarily derived genera with obligate multiple mating (the Acromyrmex and Atta leafcutter ants) as well as phylogenetically basal genera with exclusively single mating (e.g. Apterostigma, Cyphomyrmex, Myrmicocrypta). All attine genera share the unique characteristic of obligate dependence on symbiotic fungus gardens for food, but the sophistication of this symbiosis differs considerably across genera. The lower attine genera generally have small, short-lived colonies and relatively non-specialized fungal symbionts (capable of living independently of their ant hosts), whereas the four evolutionarily derived higher attine genera have highly specialized, long-term clonal symbionts. In this paper, we investigate whether the transition from single to multiple mating occurred relatively recently in the evolution of the attine ants, in conjunction with the novel herbivorous `leafcutter' niche acquired by the common ancestor of Acromyrmex and Atta, or earlier, at the transition to rearing specialized long-term clonal fungi in the common ancestor of the larger group of higher attines that also includes the genera Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex. We use DNA microsatellite analysis to provide unambiguous evidence for a single, late and abrupt evolutionary transition from exclusively single to obligatory multiple mating. This transition is historically correlated with other evolutionary innovations, including the extensive use of fresh vegetation as substrate for the fungus garden, a massive increase in mature colony size and morphological differentiation of the worker caste.},

The taxonomic history of this group of wasps is reviewed, along with a critique of previous phylogenetic studies on the group. Molecular data were sampled from forty-six species representing twenty-six genera of microgastrines, plus three species representing the close outgroup taxa Cardiochilinae and Miracinae.

	abstract = {The Eucoilinae are a diverse and important group of parasitoids of Diptera, particularly in the tropics, but they are poorly known systematically and their generic classification is partly chaotic. Here, we present the first comprehensive cladistic analysis of higher eucoiline relationships. The analysis is based on 148 skeletal characters of adults documented in more than 1100 digital images available in an Internet-accessible database. The characters were coded for 45 taxa representing 35 eucoiline genera, spanning the entire diversity of the group, and 7 outgroup genera. Relationships were partly difficult to resolve and parsimony analysis under implied weights performed considerably better than analysis under uniform weights. The results support the monophyly of the Eucoilinae and show that eucoilines are most closely related to the figitid subfamilies Emargininae and Pycnostigminae, but are ambiguous concerning the exact relationships among these three lineages. Of the 6 eucoiline genus groups recognized by Nordlander in 1982 (Entomol. Scand. 13, 269-292), only 2 are supported as monophyletic: the Trybliographa and Kleidotoma groups. The Gronotoma group is a paraphyletic assemblage of two different basal clades of eucoilines. The Rhoptromeris group is unnatural and only the 2 core genera, Rhoptromeris and Trichoplasta, form a monophyletic lineage. The data are ambiguous concerning the Ganaspis group, which appears to be paraphyletic, and the Chrestosema group, which may be a good clade. Based on the results we propose a modified system of informal genus groups in the Eucoilinae and discuss putative synapomorphies supporting each genus group.

The earliest split in the group was apparently between an Afrotropical and a Neotropical lineage, and much of the early radiation of the group occurred in these regions, particularly in the Neotropics.

	abstract = {The nematine sawfly Euura mucronata Hartig (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) induces galls in the buds of over 30 willow species across the Holarctic region. This extensive host range is surprising, since the other Euura gallers are mostly monophagous; thus, the feeding habit of E. mucronata would represent a switch from monophagy to extreme polyphagy. Previous morphological studies have divided E mucronata into separate species, but the feeding ranges of these species are unknown, and it is even doubtful whether multiple species really exist. To study whether or not E. mucronata consists of cryptic host-associated sibling species, an allozyme study was conducted using gallers collected from six willow species occuring in northern Fennoscandia. Electrophoretic data from seven variable enzyme loci show that: (1) `E. mucronata' probably comprises at least three species with restricted host ranges, but the species may not be completely reproductively isolated from each other; (2) the pattern of host use is not explained by the phylogeny of willows; (3) the pattern of host use is not concordant with the overall chemical similarity of the hosts; and (4) simple allopatric speciation does not appear to explain the host associations. Consequently, it is possible that reasons such as differences in host phenology, habitat, or morphology, are responsible for the limits in host use in the group.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia is a maternally inherited bacterium that may manipulate the reproduction of its arthropod hosts. In insects, it is known to lead to inviable matings, cause asexual reproduction or kill male offspring, all to its own benefit, but to the detriment of its host. In social Hymenoptera, Wolbachia occurs widely, but little is known about its fitness effects. We report on a Wolbachia infection in the wood ant Formica truncorum, and evaluate whether it influences reproductive patterns. All 33 colonies of the study population were infected, suggesting that Wolbachia infection is at, or close to, fixation. Interestingly, in colonies with fewer infected workers, significantly more sexuals are produced, indicating that Wolbachia has deleterious effects in this species. In addition, adult workers are shown to have significantly lower infection rates (45\%) than worker pupae (87\%) or virgin queens (94\%), suggesting that workers lose their infection over life. Clearance of Wolbachia infection has, to our knowledge, never been shown in any other natural system, but we argue that it may, in this case, represent an adaptive strategy to reduce colony load. The cause of fixation requires further study, but our data strongly suggest that Wolbachia has no influence on the sex ratio in this species.},

The taxonomic level at which specific genes or nucleotide regions are useful varies across taxa. This study assesses the relative phylogenetic usefulness of a segment of a noncoding ribosomal region (ITS2) in separating populations of the parasitoid Ageniaspis citricola (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) from different geographic areas (Australia and Taiwan). Intra- and interindividual variations in ITS2 sequence and length have affected previous phylogenetic studies with other arthropods. To determine whether these variations would affect our phylogenetic studies, clones (2-3/individual) containing ITS2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were sequenced from two to five individuals for each of the two populations. Three clones from one A. fuscicollis (a species present only in Europe) individual were used for comparison. Intra- and interindividual variations in ITS2 sequence and length were present in the three Ageniaspis populations. Intraindividual sequence variation was sometimes greater than between individuals in each Ageniaspis population. All clones isolated from a single individual were different, and no single variant was common to all wasps in any Ageniaspis population. The variation in sequence and length of the ITS2 region in Ageniaspis populations suggests that concerted evolution has not homogenized all rDNA copies within individuals. Despite the level of intraindividual variation found, the sequences of this ITS2 region were phylogenetically informative and defined the three populations (A. citricola Australian and Taiwanese, and A. fuscicollis). These results confirm previous molecular work using RAPD-PCR and Actin genes and suggest that the two populations of Ageniaspis from Australia and Taiwan are cryptic species.},

By examining the phylogenetic patterns of solitary and social behavior and how they correlate with ecological variables, we may identify factors important in the evolution of sociality. In this study, we investigated historical and biogeographical patterns of sociality in a socially polymorphic bee species (one that demonstrates both social and solitary nesting behavior). This unique system allows for a more powerful examination of evolutionary transitions in sociality than interspecific studies of obligately social and solitary species. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis among populations of the halictine bee Halictus rubicundus and then identified relationships among mitochondrial DNA sequence data. sociality, environmental conditions at the nesting site, and geographic location of populations of this species. Within North America, populations of H. rubicundus expressing social and solitary behavior belong to different genetic lineages. Sociality is also correlated with at least one environmental variable used in this study. Taken together, the results support the predictions for genetic control of sociality, but they are still consistent with social behavior at some level being determined by the environmental conditions at the nesting site.},

Further, mapping of rearrangement characters onto this phylogeny of the Braconidae indicated parallel inversions of the mt-tRNA(D) gene, with the two instances of inversion distinguishable by the presence or absence of an additional tRNA gene (tRNA(H)).

We report sequence divergence values and saturation levels and compare phylogenetic results of these sequences analyzed both separately and combined to a well-corroborated morphological phylogeny. Likelihood ratio tests were used to find the best evolutionary model fitting each of the markers. The likelihood model best explaining the data is, for most loci, parameter rich, with strong A-T bias for mitochondrial loci and strong rate heterogeneity for the majority of loci. Our data suggest that 28S rDNA, elongation factor 1-alpha, and long-wavelength opsin may be potentially useful markers for the resolution of cynipid and other insect within-family-level divergences (circa 50-100 mya old), whereas mitochondrial loci and ITS regions are most useful for lower-level phylogenetics. In contrast, the 18S rDNA marker is likely to be useful for the resolution of above-family-level relationships. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science (USA).},

The sequences were aligned to the corresponding sequences in the honey bee. Phylogenetic analyses based on parsimony, as well as maximum likelihood, indicate that the bumblebees can be separated into several well-supported clades. Most of the terminal clades correspond very well with the clades known from former phylogenetic analyses based on morphology and recognized as the subgenera: Mendacibombus, Confusibombus, Psithyrus, Thoracobombus, Megabombus, Rhodobombus, Kallobombus, Alpinobombus, Subterraneobombus, Alpigenobombus, Pyrobombus, Bombus and Melanobombus. All the cuckoo bumblebees form a well-supported clade, the subgenus Psithyrus, within the true bumblebees. All the analyses place Kallobombus as the most basal taxon in contradiction to former analyses. The other deeper nodes of the phylogenetic trees, which are weakly supported, deviate significantly from former published trees - especially the trees based on mtCO-I. Presumably, the reasons are that multiple hits and the strong bias of the bases A and T blur the relationships in the deepest part of the trees. Analyses of the region in mtCO-I show a very strong A+T bias (A+T=75\%), which also indicate preferences in the use of codons with A or T in third positions. In closely related entities, there is only a weak transversion bias (A+T). In the studied regions in EF1-alpha, no nucleotide bias is observed. The observed differences in bases between the investigated taxa are relatively small and the gene is too conserved to solve all the questions that the analyses of the deeper nodes using mtCO-I raise.},

Such heterogeneous datasets are likely to require distinct models of analysis, given the different histories of mutational biases operating on these characters. The incongruence length difference (ILD) test is increasingly being used to arbitrate between competing models of phylogenetic analysis in cases where multiple data partitions have been collected. Our work suggests that the ILD test is unlikely to be an effective measure of congruence when two datasets differ markedly in size. We show that models that increase the contribution of one data partition over another are likely to increase congruence, as measured by this test. More alarmingly, for many bipartition comparisons, character congruence increases bimodally-either increasing or decreasing the contribution of one data partition will increase congruence-making it impossible to arrive at a single optimally congruent model of analysis.},

Parsimony analyses, employing a broad range of models, consistently recovered the Proctotrupomorpha as a natural group, the Megalyridae and Trigonalidae as sister groups, a clade comprising the Monomachidae, Diapriidae, and Maamingidae, the Vanhorniidae and Proctotrupidae as sister groups, the Proctotrupoidea as polyphyletic, and the Evaniomorpha as a grade (but including the Ichneumonoidea, Aculeata, and Stephanidae). The Proctotrupomorpha, containing virtually all of the wholly endoparasitic lineages, was consistently recovered as an apical clade, with the remaining groups forming a paraphyletic grade below them. Although the relative placement of the groups forming this basal grade varied among analyses, the most commonly recovered arrangement is consistent with the ancestral biology being ectoparasitism of coleopteran, wood-boring larvae. Furthermore, the recovery of the ectoparasitic-containing proctotrupomorphs (Chalcidoidea and, in some analyses, Ceraphronoidea) as apical lineages argues that these biologies are reversals.

Cytochrome b had the same level of sequence variation and A/T bias as COI, but was less useful for recovering intergeneric relationships.

For the class Insecta, we found that functional conservation of amino acids occurs for the same regions as those found in vertebrates with the exception of Mallophaga (lice). Lice have an accelerated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions. Accelerated rate of cyt-b nucleotide and amino acid evolution in Apidae (bees) may be correlated with increased metabolic rates associated with facultative endothermy (= heterothermy).

	abstract = {Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) is a highly conserved nuclear coding gene that can be used to investigate recent divergences due to the presence of rapidly evolving introns. However, a universal feature of intron sequences is that even closely related species exhibit insertion and deletion events, which cause variation in the lengths of the sequences. Indels are frequently rich in evolutionary information, but most investigators ignore sites that fall within these variable regions, largely because the analytical tools and theory are not well developed. We examined this problem in the taxonomically problematic parasitoid wasp genus Pauesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) using congruence as a criterion for assessing a range of methods for aligning such variable-length EF-1 alpha intron sequences. These methods included distance- and parsimony-based multiple-alignment programs (CLUSTAL W and MALIGN), direct optimization (POY), and two “by eye” alignment strategies. Furthermore, with one method (CLUSTAL W) we explored in detail the robustness of results to changes in the gap cost parameters. Phenetic-based alignments (”by eye” and CLUSTAL W) appeared, under our criterion, to perform as well as more readily defensible, but computationally more demanding, methods. In general, all of our alignment and tree-building strategies recovered the same basic topological structure, which means that an underlying phylogenetic signal remained regardless of the strategy chosen. However, several relationships between clades were sensitive both to alignment and to tree-building protocol. Further alignments, considering only sequences belonging to the same group, allowed us to infer a range of phylogenetic relationships that were highly robust to tree-building protocol. By comparing these topologies with those obtained by varying the CLUSTAL parameters, we generated the distribution area of congruence and taxonomic compatibility. Finally, we present the first robust estimate of the European Pauesia phylogeny by using two EF-1 alpha introns and 38 taxa (plus 3 outgroups). This estimate conflicts markedly with the traditional subgeneric classification. We recommend that this classification be abandoned, and we propose a series of monophyletic species groups.},

However, the corbiculate tribes are believed to be of Cretaceous age, and strong support for insect clades of this age from small data sets of nucleotide sequence data has rarely been demonstrated. To more critically assess opsin's phylogenetic utility we generated an expanded LW Rh data set by sequencing the same gene fragment from 52 additional bee species from 24 tribes and all six extant bee families, Analyses of this data set failed to provide substantial support for monophyly of corbiculate bees, for relationships among corbiculate tribes, or for most other well-established higher-level relationships among long-tongued bees. However, monophyly of nearly all genera and tribes is strongly supported, indicating that LW Rh provides useful phylogenetic signal at lower taxonomic levels. When our expanded LW Rh data set is combined with a morphological and behavioral data set for corbiculate bees, the results unambiguously support the traditional phylogeny of the corbiculate bee tribes: (Euglossini + (Bombini + (Meliponini + Apini))). This implies a single origin of advanced eusocial behavior among bees rather than dual origins, as proposed by several recent studies. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {Animal societies depend on effective defence of group resources. Defensive mechanisms can be costly and may constrain the evolution of social structure. We analysed how exocrine mechanisms of colony defence were affected by the evolution of social complexity and of nest architecture in paper wasps (Vespidae). Eusocial paper wasp species exhibit two discrete grades of eusociality, with new colonies founded either by queens or by coordinated swarms of queens and workers. Swarm-founding shows multiple evolutionary origins from independent-founding ancestors within the Vespidae. Nest architecture also varies among paper wasps. Nests with covering envelopes evolved from naked combs several times. We hypothesized that: (1) evolutionary transitions from independent- to swarm-founding would obviate the need for chemical defence against ants and (2) transitions from naked combs to enveloped nests would have a similar effect on chemical defence. In support of the first hypothesis, we found that all independent-founding species possess ant-repellent glands (Van der Vecht's gland), while many swarm-founders do not. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggested that evolutionary loss of this gland was statistically more likely to follow transitions to swarm-founding. Evolution of nest envelopes was less strongly associated with losses of the ant repellent gland. These patterns suggest that maintenance of defensive exocrine glands is costly. The patterns also suggest that group behavioural defence against ants is a key adaptive feature associated with the evolution of swarm-founding. The hypothesis that the evolution of nest envelopes obviated chemical defence against ants was not as well supported.},

We investigate the effects of using different outgroup combinations to root the estimated tree. We also consider various ways in which biases in the sequence data could be misleading, using several maximum likelihood models, LogDet corrections, and spectral analyses. Ultimately, we concede there is strong discordance between the molecular and morphological data partitions and appropriately apply the conditional combination approach in this case. We also find two equally well supported placements of the root for the molecular trees, one supported by 16S and 28S sequences, the other supported by cytochrome b and opsin. The strength of the evidence leads us to accept two equally well supported hypotheses based on analyses of the molecular data sets.

The phylogenetic relationships of fig wasps pollinating functionally dioecious Ficus were inferred from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene sequences (mtDNA) and morphology. Separate and combined analyses indicated that the pollinators of functionally dioecious figs are not monophyletic. However, pollinator relationships were generally congruent with host phylogeny and support a revised classification of Ficus. Ancestral changes in pollinator ovipositor length also correlated with changes in fig breeding systems. In particular, the relative elongation of the ovipositor was associated with the repeated loss of functionally dioecious pollination. The concerted evolution of interacting morphologies may bias estimates of phylogeny based on female head characters, but homoplasy is not so strong in other morphological traits. The lesser phylogenetic utility of morphology than of mtDNA is not due to rampant convergence in morphology but rather to the greater number of potentially informative characters in DNA sequence data; patterns of nucleotide substitution also limit the utility of mtDNA findings. Nonetheless, inferring the ancestral associations of fig pollinators from the best-supported phylogeny provided strong evidence of host conservatism in this highly specialized mutualism.},

	abstract = {Carpenter bees, genus Xylocopa Latreille, a group of bees found on all continents, are of particular interest to behavioral ecologists because of their utility for studies of the evolution of mating strategies and sociality. This paper presents phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of two mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase 1 and cytochrome b for 22 subgenera of Xylocopa. Maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods were used to infer phylogenetic relationships. The analyses resulted in three resolved clades of subgenera: a South American group (including the subgenera Stenoxylocopa, Megaxylocopa, and Neoxylocopa), a group including the subgenera Xylocopa s.s. and Ctenoxylocopa, and an Ethiopean group (including the subgenera Afroxylocopa, Mesotrichia, Alloxylocopa, Platynopoda, Hoploxylocopa, and Koptortosoma). The relationships between the 11 other subgenera and the resolved clades are unclear. Within the Ethiopian group we found a clear separation of the African and the Oriental tars and apparent polyphyly of the subgenus Koptortosoma. Using an evolutionary rate for ants, we investigated whether Gondwana vicariance or more recent dispersal events could best explain the present-day distribution of subgenera. Although some tars show divergences that approach Gondwanan breakup times, most divergences between geographic groups are too recent to support a vicariance hypothesis. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

The outgroup taxa showed complete TAA CO1 stop codons, but dolichoderines have either TA or T. The outgroup taxa showed a noncoding gap between the CO1 and the tRNA(UUR)(Leu) genes. A phylogeny-independent compatibility test using the amino acid sequences showed differences between the genes consistent with variation in evolutionary rates, according with other studies. Base compositions proved heterogeneous between species, hence phylogenetic analysis was restricted to the protein sequences using maximum likelihood and the mtREV24 replacement matrix. A maximum-likelihood consensus tree has similarities to those from morphological studies with some exceptions such Leptomyrmex falling within the dolichoderine genera rather than basally, and the accretion of genera formerly included under Iridomyrmex. Features of the tRNA genes and the CO1 termination codons agree quite well with the molecular phylogeny. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Mating frequency was calculated from within-colony relatedness estimated by CAP-PCR DNA fingerprinting. Most queens of lower attines and T. isthmicus mated with only one male, while those of the three higher attines mated with multiple males. Mating frequency was positively correlated with colony size. Polyethism among workers was dependent on worker age in lower attines but on body size in higher attines, suggesting some correlation between mating frequency (i.e., within-colony gene diversity) and caste complexity. The sex ratio was biased toward females in species where the mating frequency equaled one, but toward males in species where the mating frequency was greater than two. Changing in nest site from ground surface to deep underground may have facilitated the evolution of large colony size in Attini, and this may have resulted in the evolution of polyandry (a queen mates with multiple males). With the evolution of polyandry in higher attines, Atta and Acromyrmex in particular have generated high genetic diversity within their colonies and complex social structures.},

From approximately 428- and 417-base pair aligned sequences of the 16S rDNA and cyt b gene, 185 and 171 variable sites were detected. As reported for some other insect groups, a strong A+T composition bias (78.3\%) and A-T transversion bias (54.5\% of all nucleotide substitutions) were detected in the 16S rDNA of anthocorid insects. However, in the cyt b gene, A-T transversions (29.2\%) were less frequent than T-C transitions (39.8\%), even though this gene also contained a relatively high level of A+T (70.7\%). In the 16S rDNA, uncorrected genetic divergence increased linearly with an increase in taxonomic level. However, a plateau was observed in the values of the cyt b gene. This tendency was obvious in the third position of codons, in which the values increased very quickly and saturated at the between-subgenus level. These findings suggest that strong multiple substitutions occur in this position. Phylogenetic analyses showed that both the 16S rDNA and cyt b DNA fragments can be used to estimate relationships among anthocorid taxa, even though there are differences between them as regards taxonomic levels at which phylogenetic analysis can be applied.},

Evidence suggests that the group radiated on Gondwanaland after the separation of,Africa/India/Madagascar, bur prior to the separation of Australia.

Using this new information, the relationships of Old World Oraseminae were reanalyzed. After successive weighting of 48 trees, a set of six trees (length 191, retention index 0.80) was found, that matched the earlier hypothesis. To better evaluate behavioral traits of Oraseminae, nine species groups of Orasema from the New World were characterized and included in a separate analysis, resulting in 54 successively weighted trees (length 204 steps, retention index 0.81). Results suggest that a host shift to Pheidole (Myrmicinae) and internal parasitism of the host larva by the first-instar larva, with a later shift to external parasitism of the pupa, are derived for Oraseminae. All Oraseminae deposit eggs into punctures formed. in the plant tissue by the ovipositor, but the habit of laying single eggs is plesiomorphic for Orasema and laying multiple eggs is derived for Orasemorpha and Timioderus. The use of an intermediate host for gaining access to the ant host appears to have been derived. twice within Oraseminae.},

Maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses resulted in essentially the same phylogeny with high support for important branches. The results show that: (1) the galling species probably form a monophyletic group; (2) true closed galls evolved only once, via leaf folders; (3) with the possible exception of leaf rollers, all gall type groups are mono- or paraphyletic; (4) similar gall types are closer on the phylogeny than would be expected by a random process; (5) there is an apparent evolutionary trend in galling site from the leaf edge towards the more central parts of the host plant; and (6) many willow species have been colonized several times, which excludes the possibility of parallel cladogenesis between willows and the gallers; however, there are signs of restrictions in the evolution of host use.

The Ephedrini have the least specialized oviposition behaviour within the subfamily, with Praini and Aphidiini displaying various adaptations for host capture and oviposition. Use of the forelegs to grasp and orient aphids for oviposition has arisen twice, in Praini and, independently, in the genus Monoctonus Haliday (Aphidiini: Monoctonina). Morphological modifications of the terminal abdominal segments for host capture are found in Trioxina and in several species of Pauesia Quills (Aphidiina). A “quick” sting is characteristic of species in the genus Aphidius Nees and related genera. The greatest degree of behavioural diversification occurred among Pauesia species, including cryptic behaviour, ant mimicry, and “sneak” oviposition. Acquired chemical camouflage and mimicry of the host's cuticular hydrocarbon pattern to avoid detection by guarding ants is found in Aclitus obscuripennis Foerster, the genus Paralipsis Foerster, and the two closely related genera Adialytus Foerster and Lysiphlebus Foerster. It is suggested that the main driving forces in the evolution of parasitoid oviposition behaviour were aphid defensive behaviour and avoidance of aggression by trophobiotic ants.

B. nevadensis is basal to the other species in the analysis of the cytochrome b gene, but appears to be among the most derived according to the analysis of the COI region.

Species that appear in very different positions in different trees are B. nevadensis, B. mesomelas, B. balteatus, and B. hyperboreus. All subgenera with two representatives in our analysis are apparently monophyletic except Fervidobombus, Melanobombus, and Pyrobombus.

The results from this second analysis favor either the three-tribes hypothesis (Ephedrini, Praini, and Aphidiini) or a new classification with at least five tribes (Ephedrini, Praini, Monoctonini, Trioxini, and Aphidiini), The 18S rDNA gene is a useful marker to recover relationships not only at the tribe but also at the subtribe and genus levels in this group, The natural status of some traditionally accepted clusters is also corroborated with the present data whereas the placement of other clusters is questioned or remains unresolved.

The present study confirms the presence of large mushroom bodies in five subfamilies of vespid wasps, while at the same time showing significant departures from the mushroom body organization that typifies bees and ants. Although the basic organizational plan of the insect mushroom body into calyces, peduncle, and lobes is maintained, as is the arrangement of axons of intrinsic neurons, the size and arrangements of the vespid mushroom body lobes differ markedly from those known from other Hymenoptera. Furthermore, considerable variation is found both between and within vespid subfamilies.

	abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships among Palaearctic species of the ant genus Tetramorium and its social parasites of the genera Strongylognathtus, Anergates and Teletomyrmex, were investigated electrophoretically at 21 presumptive enzyme loci. The data set comprising 33 species was analysed with distance (UPGMA, Neighbor-joining and least squares statistics) and parsimony methods (independent allele, minimum turnover and mutation coding) in order to rule out analysis-dependent effects. Several groupings were consistently resolved by all procedures. Observed branching patterns support the placement of the three parasite genera and their hosts into the Palaearctic species group of Tetramorium (tribe Tetramoriini). The genus Strongylognathus forms a monophyletic group in which the slave-makers of the S. huberi group constitute the sister group of the inquilines S. testaceus and S. karawajewi (S, testaceus group). Most species of the S. huberi group show very low genetic differentiation. However, little consensus has been found with regard to which Tetramorium species are the closest relatives of Strongylognathus. According to the electrophoretic data, social parasitism in Palaearctic tetramoriine ants has evolved independently at least twice. Though inquilinism once arose from slave-making ancestors in Strongylognathus, the extreme inquilines Anergates atratulus and Teleutomyrmex schneideri are clearly set apart from the Strongylognathus clade in phylogenetic analyses. Thus, extreme inquilinism cannot be regarded as the endpoint of a single parasitic lineage in the Tetramoriini. In these highly advanced inquilines, evolutionary rates at allozyme loci appear to be higher than those of their Tetramorium hosts. The results do not unambiguously reveal whether Anergates and Teleutomyrmex arose jointly or independently from Tetramorium ancestors. However, a combined analysis using all available evidence supports the former hypothesis. The finding that the Tetramorium parasites are not the closest relatives of their respective host species is discussed in relation to current theories for the evolution of social parasitism.},

In order to resolve basal relationships within Halictus we applied various weighting schemes under parsimony (successive approximations character weighting and implied weights) and employed ML under 17 models of sequence evolution. Weighted parsimony yielded conflicting results but, in general, supported the hypothesis that Seladonia + Vestitohalictus is sister to Michener's Group 3 and renders Halictus s.s. paraphyletic. ML analyses using the GTR model with site-specific rates supported an alternative hypothesis: Seladonia + Vestitohalictus is sister to Halictus s.s. We mapped social behavior onto trees obtained under ML and parsimony in order to reconstruct the likely historical pattern of social evolution. Our results are unambiguous: the ancestral state for the genus Halictus is eusociality. Reversal to solitary behavior has occurred at least four times among the species included in our analysis.

This paper presents a phylogenetic analysis of Lasioglossum species and subgenera based on a data set consisting of 1240 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene for seventy-seven taxa (sixty-six ingroup and eleven outgroup taxa). Maximum parsimony was used to analyse the data set (using PAUP*4.0) by a variety of weighting methods, including equal weights, a priori weighting and a posteriori weighting. All methods yielded roughly congruent results. Michener's Hemihalictus series was found to be monophyletic in all analyses but one, while his Lasioglossum series formed a basal, paraphyletic assemblage in all analyses but one. Chilalictus was consistently found to be a basal taxon of Lasioglossum sensu late and Lasioglossum sensu stricto was found to be monophyletic. Within the Hemihalictus series, major lineages included Dialictus + Paralictus, the acarinate Evylaeus + Hemihalictus + Sudila and the carinate Evylaeus + Sphecodogastra. Relationships within the Hemihalictus series were highly stable to altered weighting schemes, while relationships among the basal subgenera in the Lasioglossum series (Lasioglossum s.s., Chilalictus, Parasphecodes and Ctenonomia) were unclear. The social parasite of Dialictus, Paralictus, is consistently and unambiguously placed well within Dialictus, thus rendering Dialictus paraphyletic. The implications of this for understanding the origins of social parasitism are discussed.},

Similar incongruent topologies are obtained if the morphological data are partitioned by either of two methods: distinguishing (I) characters of the larval stage and female reproductive system, or (2) characters selected individually by the authors prior to the analysis as likely to be mechanistically associated with endo/ectoparasitism.

	abstract = {The Pseudomyrmex viduus group is a Neotropical clade of arboreal ants containing 13 species, of which three are newly described here: P. insuavis, P. ultrix, and P. vitabilis. Most species inhabit the domatia of specialized ant-plants. The ants keep brood and scale insects (Coccoidea) in the plant cavities, and defend their nest sites much more aggressively than do generalist species of Pseudomyrmex nesting in dead twigs. Five species are obligate associates of trees in the genus Triplaris (Polygonaceae) and five taxa are restricted to Tachigali (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae). One species, P. viduus (F. Smith), is much less host-specific, inhabiting Cordia, Coussapoa, Ocotea, Pseudobombax, Pterocarpus, Sapium, Triplaris and other myrmecophytes. Nothing is known about the biology of P. vitabilis, a close relative of P. viduus. The last member of the species group, P. kuenckeli (Emery), is a non-specialist but aggressive species that nests in dead branches of various plants. A cladistic analysis indicates that this aggressive behaviour evolved before obligate associations with specialized ant-plants. and that the Triplaris and Tachigali inhabitants each form their own clade. P. viduus, which is nested within the Triplaris-associated clade, suggests a possible model for host plant evolution in these ants wherein shifts from one ant-plant to another involve an intermediate phase of expanded host plant use. At least nine other Pseudomyrmex species, from two different species groups (not closely related to the P. viduus group), have evolved specialized associations with Triplaris or Tachigali including five new species: P. crudelis, P. deminutus, P. eculeus, P. ferox and P. hospitalis. Although the P. viduus group is centred in the Amazon basin, the geographic ranges of most species do nor coincide with the Pleistocene forest refugia proposed by Haffer and others. A consideration of the phylogenetic relationships, distribution patterns, and host plant specificity of the ants indicates that much of the diversification of the P. viduus group occurred before the Pleistocene, and that the interactions with Triplaris and Tachigali plants are also of Tertiary origin.},

	abstract = {Sex allocation data in eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) provide an excellent opportunity to assess the effectiveness of kin selection, because queens and workers differ in their relatedness to females and males. The first studies on sex allocation in eusocial Hymenoptera compared population sex investment ratios across species. Female-biased investment in monogyne (= with single-queen colonies) populations of ants suggested that workers manipulate sex allocation according to their higher relatedness to females than males (relatedness asymmetry). However, several factors may confound these comparisons across species. First, variation in relatedness asymmetry is typically associated with major changes in breeding system and life history that may also affect sex allocation. Secondly, the relative cost of females and males is difficult to estimate across sexually dimorphic taxa, such as ants. Thirdly, each species in the comparison may not represent an independent data point, because of phylogenetic relationships among species. Recently, stronger evidence that workers control sex allocation has been provided by intraspecific studies of sex ratio variation across colonies. In several species of eusocial Hymenoptera, colonies with high relatedness asymmetry produced mostly females, in contrast to colonies with low relatedness asymmetry which produced mostly males. Additional signs of worker control were found by investigating proximate mechanisms of sex ratio manipulation in ants and wasps. However, worker control is not always effective, and further manipulative experiments will be needed to disentangle the multiple evolutionary factors and processes affecting sex allocation in eusocial Hymenoptera.},

In order to understand both the biogeographical history of the Ceratosolen species associated with Ficus of the subgenus Sycomorus and the origins of the specificity breakdown cases, we have used cytochrome b sequences to reconstruct a phylogeny of the fig wasps. The results show that the pollinators from the Malagasy region and those from continental Africa form two distinct clades, which probably diverged after the crossing of the Mozambique Channel by an ancestral population. The Oriental wasp species show strong affinities with the African species. The two species-specificity exceptions are due to different evolutionary events. The occurrence of the two West African pollinators associated with F. sur can be explained by successive speciation events of the mutualistic partner without plant radiation. In contrast, we hypothesize that C. galili shifted by horizontal transfer from an unknown, presumably extinct, Ficus species to F, sycomorus after this native Malagasy fig species colonized Africa.

However, many of them are based on a limited number of characters and/or taxa and lack congruence. In addition, many of the inferred phylogenies have not been based upon cladistic analysis. Therefore, a phylogenetic study of Aphidiinae was undertaken, utilizing 465 bp of DNA sequence of the mitochondrial NADH1 dehydrogenase gene.

It is suggested that in agreement with most of the previously proposed phylogenies, the aphidiines, each of the three recognized tribes (Praini, Ephedrini, Aphidiini), and most genera are monophyletic. In contrast to previously proposed phylogenies, the clade of Praon + Dyscritulus (=Praini), rather than Ephedrini, is basal among the aphidiines. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {The arrangement of tRNA Penes at the junction of the cytochrome oxidase II and ATPase 8 genes was examined across a broad range of Hymenoptera. Seven distinct arrangements of tRNA genes were identified among a group of wasps that have diverged over the last 180 Myr (suborder Apocrita); many of the rearrangements represent evolutionarily independent events. Approximately equal proportions of local rearrangements, inversions, and translocations were observed, in contrast to vertebrate mitochondria, in which local rearrangements predominate. Surprisingly, homoplasy was evident among certain types of rearrangement; a reversal of the plesiomorphic gene order has arisen on three separate occasions in the Insecta. while the tRNA(H) gene has been translocated to this locus on two separate occasions. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this gene translocation is real and is not an artifactual translocation resulting from the duplication of a resident tRNA gene followed by mutation of the anticodon. The nature of the intergenic sequences surrounding this region does not indicate that it should be especially prone to rearrangement, it does not generally have the tandem or inverted repeats that might facilitate this plasticity. Intriguingly, these findings are consistent with the view that during the evolution of the Hymenoptera, rearrangements increased at the same time that the rate of point mutations and compositional bias also increased. This association may direct investigations into mitochondrial genome plasticity in other invertebrate lineages.},

	abstract = {An hypothesis of genealogical relationships among taxa provides an historical map along which character evolution (e.g., social traits) can be traced to reveal patterns of common origin or repeated but independent evolution. To investigate the evolution of social traits in the allodapine bee genus Exoneurella, we have derived a species phylogeny based on 32 morphological features of adult and immature stages and sequences from 2 mitochondrial DNA genes, cytochrome oxidise I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b). The morphological and COI data support the close relationships of Brevineura and Exoneurella in accord with previous hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships among allodapine Lees. In contrast, the Cyt b data supported the sister-group relationship of Braunsapis and Exoneurella. This was most likely caused by long branch attraction or convergent patterns in the Cyt b data set. The morphological and COI data support the basal position of E. tridentata in the Exoneurella clade. Applying different weights to transversions versus transitions in the analyses of COI sequence data produced 2 trees with 1 totally congruent with the morphological data set. The other tree differed in terms of the arrangement of the 3 distal species of Exoneurella: E. lawsoni, E. eremophila, and E. setosa. Combined analysis of the 3 data sets yields the following species relationship in Exoneurella: (tridentata + [ lawsoni + (setosa + eremophila)]). The A-T rich mitochondrial genome of bees affects the rate of nucleotide substitution leading to the predominance of transversions over transitions and effectively lowering the saturation threshold for transitions. This resulted in transversions accounting for almost all of the informative changes on the tree, even at the species level.},

The ITS2 sequences of a group of sibling species of the T. deion/T. pretiosum complexes were determined. A simple and precise identification key to the species of these assemblages was constructed using as taxonomic characters the size of the ITS2 and the difference in restriction length polymorphism of species with similarly sized ITS2. Individual wasps can be identified by amplification of their ITS2 with general primers, determining the size of the PCR product using standard agarose electrophoresis, followed in some species by a DNA-digestion with a restriction enzyme. Because this system works well for a number of closely related species we are hopeful that similar PCR-based identification can be extended to all species of the genus once their ITS2 sequences have been determined. The advantage of this identification system over the morphology-based system is that non-specialists are able to quickly and cheaply identify individual specimens. In addition, species specific primers were tested for the two most common species of these groups (i.e. T. pretiosum and T. deion). These primers can be used either as a direct identification tool or as a method to confirm the identification using the general key. The phylogeny of this group of wasps was also analyzed based on the ITS2 sequence.},

In Apis, this organ consists of an unpaired ampulla from which blood vessels that extend into the antennae originate. The ampulla is a very delicate structure of elastic connective tissue. Its lumen communicates with the head hemocoel via numerous perforations in its wall. No specific ampulla muscles exist; contraction of pharynx dilators causes compression of the ampulla, whereby hemolymph is forced into the antennae. An absence of directly-acting muscles is common to the functional morphologies of the antennal circulatory organ in all investigated Hymenoptera. Some anatomical characters of this organ, however, vary among taxa: (i) presence of one or two ampullae, (ii) optional dorsal hemolymph channel, which connects the ampulla with the dorsal vessel, (iii) optional ampulla pumping case formed by cuticular apophyses, and (iv) differences in shape and number of the ampulla openings. The distribution of these characters is discussed along the current views on the phylogeny of Hymenoptera. Comparison with other insect orders indicates an autapomorphic status for the basic functional morphology of the antennal circulatory organ in Hymenoptera. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Each spermatozoon measures about 620 mu m in length by 0.38 mu m in diameter and, when seen under the light microscope, appears to be wavy along its entire length. The head, which is approximately 105 mu m, comprises a small acrosome and a nucleus. The acrosome is made up of a cone-shaped acrosomal vesicle surrounding the perforatorium and the anterior end of the nucleus. Innumerable filaments radiate from it. The perforatorium has a diameter equal to that of the nucleus at their junction, where it fits with a concave base onto the rounded nuclear tip. The nucleus is helicoidal and completely filled with homogeneous compact chromatin. It is attached to the tail by a very long and quite electron-dense centriolar adjunct that extends anteriorly from the centriole in a spiral around the nucleus for approximately 8.5 mu m. The tail consists of an axoneme with the 9+9+2 microtubule arrangement pitched in a long helix, as well as a pair of spiraling mitochondrial derivatives (with regularly arranged cristae) that coil around the axoneme, and two small accessory bodies. As well as the spiraling of the nucleus, mitochondrial derivatives and axonemal microtubules, the sperm of B. pomorum present other very different morphological features. These features include the acrosome and centriolar adjunct, both of which differentiate the spermatozoa from the majority of sperm found in other Hymenoptera. In addition these structural variations demonstrate that the sperm of chalcidoids provide characteristics that can certainly prove useful for future phylogenetic analysis at the subfamily level and, possibly, the genus too.

I compare published data on worker size-distribution in colonies of three Atta species (A. cephalotes, A. sexdens, and A. texana) with new data from colonies of three Acromyrmex species (Ac. coronatus, Ac. octospinosus, and Ac. volcanus) in a phylogenetic context, in order to gain insight into the ecology and evolution of polymorphism in leaf-cutting ants. The leaf-cutting ants considered show striking intra- and interspecific differences in worker size-distribution that fall into three distinct and fundamentally different categories, linked with differences in basic foraging ecology: a) Large colonies of A. cephalotes, A. sexdens, and A. texana produce an extremely broad, continuous size-range of workers. In these colonies, a wide range of medium-size workers act as foragers, primarily attack the leaves and flowers of trees, with the larger foragers cutting thicker and tougher vegetation, b) Colonies of Ac. coronatus and small colonies of A. cephalotes produce a narrow range of small workers, the largest of which forage, primarily cutting the soft leaves of herbaceous plants, c) Colonies of Ac. octospinosus and Ac. volcanus produce a bimodal worker size-distribution with two distinct size castes of workers. The small workers stay inside the nest, tending the fungus garden and brood, whereas the relatively monomorphic, large workers forage for vegetation, primarily small herbs and fallen leaves, fruits, and flowers. The differences in worker size-distributions, among leaf-cutting ants appear to correspond to the ergonomics of foraging on different resources, though direct economic analyses are needed. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a narrow worker size-distribution, much like that of Ac. coronatus, was the primitive condition among leaf-cutting ants, with the bimodal and broad worker size-distribution conditions derived from this condition independently.},

	abstract = {We conducted the first extensive population genetics study of sympatric subterranean termite populations of the genus Reticulitermes (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) in which maternal gene flow across a large and varied geography was examined. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was chosen as a molecular marker because each termite colony is founded by a single diploid pair to whom all progeny are related. Each colony, therefore, carries the unique mtDNA of the foundress. Also, gene dispersion is limited to swarming or budding, neither of which results in long distance dispersion. Intra- and interspecific population subdivision was expected, therefore, to be geographically localized with colonies related by distance: the closer the more related. Species used in the study, Reticulitermes flavipes and R. virginicus, are sympatric and continuously distributed throughout the state of Georgia, U.S.A., a large and geographically diverse area. Further, colony sites cover four soil provinces and most have been regularly monitored for at least three years. Seventy-eight individuals were sampled from 21 Georgia colony sites and one Canadian colony site for comparison. Amplified mtDNA fragments were sequenced from each individual in both directions. Phylogenetic relationships were then inferred using cladistic and phenetic methods. Both methods differentiated species but demonstrated low levels of molecular divergence among R. flavipes populations. Lineages were, therefore, difficult to resolve for this species. Reticulitermes flavipes and R. virginicus populations were also significantly different genetically according to the Hudson, Boos and Kaplan (HBK) statistic, R. flavipes geographic populations, however, were not. Assumptions of intraspecific relatedness, therefore, cannot be based on geographic locations in Georgia as expected.},

We review Rasnitsyn's morphological work and derive a character matrix for fossil and recent hymenopterans from it. Parsimony analyses of this matrix under equal weights and implied weights show that there is little support for Rasnitsyn's biphyletic hypothesis, postulating a sister-group relationship between tenthredinoids and macroxyelines. instead, the data favour the conventional view that Hymenoptera excluding the Xyelidae are monophyletic. Higher-level symphytan relationships are well resolved and, except for the basal branchings, largely agree with the tree presented by Rasnitsyn. There is little convincing support for any major divisions of the Apocrita but the Microhymenoptera and the Ichneumonoidea + Aculeata appear as monophyletic groups in some analyses and require only a few extra steps in the others. The Evaniomorpha appear as a paraphyletic grade of basal apocritan lineages and enforcing monophyly of this grouping requires a considerable increase in tree length. The Ceraphronoidea are placed in the Proctotrupomorpha, close to Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea. This signal is not entirely due to loss characters that may have evolved independently in these taxa:in response to a general reduction in size. The analyses suggest that the Proctotrupomorpha may be monophyletic if the ceraphronoids are included. The Chrysidoidea are resolved in good agreement with relationships proposed by Brothers and Carpenter in 1993 but in conflict with the tree presented by Rasnitsyn. Rasnitsyn's data are largely uninformative about relationships among the Aculeata sensu stricto.

We have subdivided both Ichneumonidae and Braconidae into major groups, investigated several new character systems, reinterpreted some characters, scored several character states for extinct taxa by examining impression fossils using environment chamber scanning electron microscopy, and included data for a significant new subfamily of Braconidae from Cretaceous amber of New Jersey. Sixteen different variants of the data set were each subjected to parsimony analysis without weighting and with successive approximations weighting employing both maximum and minimum values of both the retention and rescaled consistency indices. Each analysis resulted in one of seven different strict consensus trees. Consensus trees based on subsets of these trees, selected on the basis of the optimal character compatibility index (OCCI), resulted in an eighth distinct tree. All trees had the Braconidae monophyletic with the Trachypetinae as the basal clade, and also had a clade comprising various arrangements of Apozyginae, the Rhyssalinae group, Aphidiinae and `other cyclostomes', but relationships among the remaining braconid groups varied between trees. Only one of the consensus trees had the Ichneumonidae (including Tanychorella) monophyletic. The Eoichneumonidae + Tanychora are the sister group the Braconidae in two of the consensus trees. Paxylommatinae were basal in the clade comprising the Eoichneumonidae + Tanychora and the Braconidae.

A hierarchical approach was adopted in the study through comparison of levels of sequence variation among taxa at different taxonomic levels.

More precise estimates of the shape parameter (alpha) Of the gamma distribution and the proportion of invariant sites were obtained in this study by employing a reference phylogeny and utilizing maximum-likelihood estimation. The effectiveness of this approach to recovering expected phylogenies of selected hymenopteran taxa has been tested against the use of maximum parsimony. This study finds that the 16S gene is most informative for phylogenetic analysis at two different levels: among closely related species or populations, and among tribes, subfamilies, and families.

Outgroup resolution was poor but results for the ingroup were consistent and indicate that (i) the social behaviour recorded for L. aegyptiellum is nested within a solitary background and therefore represents an origin of sociality independent of all others within the Halictidae, (ii) the monotypic subgenus Sericohalictus is a derived member of the leucozonium species-group, and (iii) L. laevigatum is not a member of this group.},

One possible route for such `horizontal transmission' is via parasitization. Here, we study this hypothesis in a complex guild of specialized parasitoids and inquilines, associated with the parthenogenetic, Wolbachia-infected gall wasp Diplolepis rosae. Diplolepis rosae galls ('bedeguar galls') were collected at three localities in The Netherlands and Germany. Specimens of most guild members were obtained. Using molecular techniques, the presence of Wolbachia was detected in five members of the assemblage. Three of these, Torymus bedeguaris, Habrocytus bedeguaris and D. rosae carried a Wolbachia belonging to the same subgroup (type I). A phylogenetic analysis was performed on DNA sequences from the FtsZ gene from these three Wolbachias. The analysis showed that the three strains do not cluster closely together, which indicates that the parasitoids have not acquired their Wolbachia from their host. We could not detect host-to-parasitoid transmission in this assemblage (where interactions are both specific, frequent, and possibly ancient).},

	abstract = {Many phylogenetic analyses, particularly morphological studies, use higher taxa (e.g., genera, families) rather than species as terminal taxa. This general approach requires dealing with interspecific variation among the species that make up the higher taxon. In this paper, I review different parsimony methods for coding and sampling higher taxa and compare their relative accuracies using computer simulations. Despite their widespread use, methods that involve coding higher taxa as terminals perform poorly in simulations, relative to splitting up the higher taxa and using species as terminals. Among the methods that use higher taxa as terminals, coding a taxon based on the most common condition among the included species (majority or modal coding) is generally more accurate than other coding methods, such as cod:ng taxa as missing or polymorphic. The success of the majority method, and results of further simulations, suggest that in many cases “common equals primitive” within variable taxa, at least for low and intermediate rates of character change. The fixed-only method (excluding variable characters) performs very poorly, a result that is indirectly supported by analyses of published data for squamate reptiles. Sampling only a single species per higher taxon also yields low accuracy under many conditions. Along with recent studies of intraspecific polymorphism, the results of this study show the general importance of (1) including characters despite variation within taxa and (2) using methods that incorporate detailed information on the distribution of states within variable taxa.},

The analysis was based on detailed study of the skeletal morphology of adults, resulting in 164 phylogenetically informative characters, complemented with a few biological characters. Thirty-seven cynipid species from thirty-one genera, including four genera of the apparently monophyletic Cynipini and almost all of the genera in the other tribes, were examined. The outgroup included exemplar species from three successively more distant cynipoid families: Figitidae (the sister group of the Cynipidae), Liopteridae and Ibaliidae. There was considerable homoplasy in the data, but many groupings in the shortest tree were nonetheless well supported, as indicated by bootstrap proportions and decay indices. Partitioning of the data suggested that the high level of homoplasy is characteristic of the Cynipidae and not the result of the amount of available phylogenetically conservative characters being exhausted. The analysis supported the monophyly of the Cynipini (oak gall wasps) which, together with the Rhoditini (the rose gall wasps), Eschatocerini and Pediaspidini formed a larger monophyletic group of gall inducers restricted to woody representatives of the eudicot subclass Rosidae. The inquilines (Synergini) were indicated to be monophyletic, whereas the Aylacini, primarily herb gall inducers, appeared as a paraphyletic assemblage of basal cynipid groups. The shortest tree suggests that the Cynipidae can be divided into three major lineages: one including the inquilines, the Aylacini genera associated with Rosaceae, and Liposthenes; one consisting entirely of Aylacini genera, among them Aulacidea, Isocolus and Neaylax; and one comprising the woody rosid gallers (the oak and rose gall wasps and allies), the Phanacis-Timaspis complex and the Aylacini genera associated with Papaveraceae.},

The Nearctic genus Cressonia Dasch is transferred to the Diacritinae from the Orthocentrinae. Tribes are not recognized in the Acaenitinae as the Coleocentrini (sensu Townes, 1971) is paraphyletic with respect to the Acaenitini.

The most complex and diverse galls are those induced on oak trees by gallwasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Cynipini), each species inducing a characteristic gall structure. Debate continues over the possible adaptive significance of gall structural traits; some protect the gall inducer from attack by natural enemies, although the adaptive significance of others remains undemonstrated. Several gall traits are shared by groups of oak gallwasp species. It remains unknown whether shared traits represent (i) limited divergence from a shared ancestral gall form, or (ii) multiple cases of independent evolution. Here we map gall character states onto a molecular phylogeny of the oak cynipid genus Andricus, and demonstrate three features of the evolution of gall structure: (ii) closely related species generally induce galls of similar structure; (ii) despite this general pattern, closely related species can induce markedly different galls; and (iii) several gall traits (the presence of many larval chambers in a single gall structure, surface resins, surface spines and internal air spaces) of demonstrated or suggested adaptive value to the gallwasp have evolved repeatedly. We discuss these results in the light of existing hypotheses on the adaptive significance of gall structure.},

With respect to the microgastroid complex of subfamilies, our data conform to morphological estimates, recovering ((Microgastrinae + Miracinae) + Cardiochilinae) + Cheloninae. The topology of our trees suggests that the cyclostome subfamilies are a natural derived group, inferring that endoparasitism (not ectoparasitism) is the ancestral state for the Braconidae, unless all of the ectoparasitic ancestors of the helconoid + microgastroid subfamilies are now extinct.},

It has been proposed that the galling habit evolved from free-living larvae via leaf folders, and that the different gall types evolved gradually in the sequence mentioned above. Thus, the galling site would have “wandered” from the leaf margin toward the stem as a result of gradual changes in oviposition site preference. Allozyme data from eight informative loci were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of 18 representative sawfly species. The results suggest that indeed leaf folders seem to be a basal group; leaf blade gallers evolved independently of the other true gallers; apical and basal leaf gallers are not the ancestors of petiole and bud gallers, but they may share a common galling ancestor; bud gallers evolved from midrib/petiole gallers; and stem gallers are polyphyletic. The cause for the observed wandering of the galling site could be intraspecific competition due to a possible “nutrient shading effect” of galls situated closer to the host plant's main vascular system.},

This copy differs from a previously described copy in the positions of five introns and in 25\% of the nucleotide sites in the coding regions. The existence of two paralogous copies of EF-1 alpha in Drosophila and Apis suggests that two copies of EF-1 alpha may be widespread in the holometabolous insect orders. To distinguish between a single, ancient gene duplication and parallel, independent fly and bee gene duplications, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of hexapod EF-1 alpha sequences. Unweighted parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequences suggests an ancient gene duplication event, whereas weighted parsimony analysis of nucleotides and unweighted parsimony analysis of amino acids suggests the contrary: that EF-1 alpha underwent parallel gene duplications in the Diptera and the Hymenoptera. The hypothesis of parallel gene duplication is supported both by congruence among nucleotide and amino acid data sets and by topology-dependent permutation tail probability (T-PTP) tests. The resulting tree topologies are also congruent with current views on the relationships among the holometabolous orders included in this study (Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera). More sequences, from diverse orders of holometabolous insects, will be needed to more accurately assess the historical patterns of gene duplication in EF-1 alpha.},

Our analysis of a preliminary data set comprised of 300 bp of sequence from the cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial gene indicates that members of some genera (e.g., Callirhytis and Andricus) do not form monophyletic groups, supporting the view of Abrahamson et al.

Sequence divergence was at appropriate levels for phylogenetic inference (2-13 percent within the Cynipini); however, extreme AT-bias (71 percent), particularly at 3rd positions in codons (95 percent) suggests the need for intensive taxon sampling, as well as more DNA characters, to avoid misleading assumptions of homology from convergent changes at these positions.},

The Trigonalidae is divided into two subfamilies, the Orthogonalinae and the Trigonalinae. Orthogonalinae consists of a single primitive genus, Orthogonalys, sharing many generalized apocritan characters, but lacking advanced trigonalid characters including antennal tyloids and female metasomal armature. No synapomorphies have been detected for the Orthogonalinae. Trigonalinae are characterized by the presence of tyloids. The Trigonalinae were originally defined by the absence of female armature, and were therefore polyphyletic because armature has been lost several times. Within the revised concept of Trigonalinae, the tribe Trigonalini is characterized by the presence of elongate parameres and an intertorulus distance subequal to the distance between the torulus and the eye. A second tribe, Nomadinini, is based on the secondary loss of tyloids, and comprises the previous subfamilies Seminotinae, Nomadininae, Bareogonalinae and Lycogastrinae. The two tribes Trigonalini and Nomadinini share the presence of female armature, although in some Trigonalini it has been secondarily lost. The genera Labidogonalos Schulz, Lycogastroides Strand, Lycogonalos Bischoff, Nanogonalos Schulz, Poecilogonalos Schulz and Taiwanogonalos Tsuneki are synonymised under Taeniogonalos Schulz. The species Lycogaster zimmeri Bischoff, Tapinogonalos maschuna Schulz, and Trigonalys pictifrons Smith (placed in Lycogaster by Schulz, 1906a) are transferred to Taeniogonalos. The genera Discenea Enderlein and Stygnogonalos Schulz are synonymised under Trigonalys Westwood. The species Labidogonalos flavescens Bischoff, L. sanctaecatharinae Schulz, Trigonalys lachrymosa Westwood (placed in Lycogaster by Bischoff, 1938), T. maculifrons Cameron (placed in Labidagonalos by Bischoff, 1938) and T. rufiventris Magretti (placed in Lycogaster by Schulz, 1907a) are transferred to Trigonalys. Trigonalys costalis Cresson is synonymised with Taeniogonalos gundlachii (Cresson). Xanthogonalos fasciatus Bertoni and X. severini Schulz are synonymised with Trigonalys sanctaecatharinae (Schulz).

Both genes can be candidate genes in studying the relationships of Fulgoroidea since the sequence Variations of both genes between species of intragenus, close affinity families, and distant affinity families are about 10\%, 20\%, and 30\%, respectively.},

This symbiont induces gamete duplication, which, in these haplodiploid organisms, results in all-female broods. Antibiotic treatment `cures' this condition, restoring normal sexual reproduction. Phylogenetic analysis of Wolbachia has shown that, in contrast with the strains in other host organisms (where the symbiont also induces different reproductive alterations), those in Trichogramma form a monophyletic group. This might be an indication of symbiont-host cocladogenesis. To test this, we performed comparative molecular phylogenetics on 20 parthenogenetic Trichogramma cultures and their Wolbachiae. We conclude that there is, in fact, little evidence for cocladogenesis. Instead, the phylogenetic distribution of the symbionts appears to result from occasional horizontal transmission, which probably takes place inside the hosts of Trichogramma parasitoids (usually lepidopteran eggs). This study therefore suggests that parthenogenesis is not only curable, it can sometimes be contagious also.},

	doi = {10.1071/IT95048},
	abstract = {The morphology of the sclerotised components of the ovipositor system is comprehensively surveyed for scelionid and platygastrid wasps, with information being assessed for 120 genera and 220 species. A diagnosis for the ovipositor system is presented for most genera to complement existing generic descriptions. Two previously described and mechanically different forms of the ovipositor system are recognised: (1) the Ceratobaeus-type that is extended and retracted by antagonistic muscles and (2) the Scelio-type that is operated by changes in hydrostatic pressure, where the ovipositor is extended at the end of an elongate telescopic tube derived from expanded intersegmental membrane between metasomal segments 6 and 7. Comparison of these forms with the supposed ground plan for the Scelionidae strongly indicates that the Scelio-type is apomorphic, that it defines a monophyletic group associated with orthopteran host eggs, and that it comprises the tribes Scelionini, Calliscelionini, most Psilanteridini, Aradophagini, Neoscelionini, Platyscelionini, Doddiellini and four genera misplaced within the Sparasionini and Baryconini (Archaeoteleia Masner, Bracalba Dodd, Chromoteleia Ashmead and Oxyscelio Kieffer), as well as Sceliacanthella Dodd. Until a more robust classification of the superfamily is forthcoming, ii is proposed that this group be informally referred to as the `Scelionini sensu lato'. Further, seven genera (Habroteleia Kieffer, Palpoteleia Kieffer, Anteris Foerster, Fusicornia Risbec, Leptoteleia Kieffer, Opisthacantha Ashmead and Styloteleia Kieffer) are misplaced in the Calliscelionini and Psilanteridini because they possess the Ceratobaeus-type system. Nixonia Masner, Sparasion Latreille and Sceliomorpha Ashmead (Sparasionini) are considered to have the most primitive ovipositor system because they possess a Ceratobaeus-type system, and sub-basally fused lateral and latero-ventral apodemes, the latter being loosely attached to sternite 6. Sparasion and Sceliomorpha also have very short lateral apodemes and this, in conjunction with the form of the apodemes, can be considered to be the ground plan for the superfamily. The Platygastridae all possess a modified ovipositor system but, nonetheless, one that in most cases is extended and retracted by musculature (i.e. Ceratobaeus-type). In particular, the system in most platygastrids is typified by having metasomal tergite 8 and associated cerci missing, the lateral apodemes short and forming a U-shape, and the ovipositor assembly generally robust. Only one of approximately 30 genera examined, Acerotella Masner, has very elongate apodemes, as in the Scelionidae. Many platygastrids also have a pair of latero-ventral apodemes, a presumed plesiomorphic character, rather than a single medial apodeme on sternite 6, which is the case for many Scelionidae. The most highly modified system is' found in Isostasius Foerster and some Synopeas (Sactogaster) Foerster, where the ovipositor assembly is coiled vertically or partly so and the apodemes are greatly reduced. Generally, characters associated with the ovipositor system do not provide any independent support for the most recent higher-level classification of platygastrids, although they show substantial potential for more accurate definition of genera. A preliminary cladistic analysis of 14 ovipositor characters supports the monophyly of five clades that correspond to the Scelionini s. l., the Scelionidae (minus the Sparasionini sensu stricto), the Sparasionini s. str., the Platygastridae, and the Sparasiodini s. str. +Platygastridae. Overall, results from this study will provide baseline information on the ovipositor system as a prelude to a more complete phylogenetic analysis of the superfamily including external morphological characters. Although no new classification for the Scelionidae and Platygastridae is proposed, their higher-level taxonomy is reviewed and discussed and cases identified where, on the basis of ovipositor morphology, taxa (tribes and/or general apparently form monophyletic groups, and where taxa are misplaced. Finally, the status of the major higher-level groups within the superfamily is discussed, as is the available evidence to support their monophyly.},

The morphological study relied primarily on genitalia characteristics, whereas the chemical study concentrated on the postpharyngeal gland constituents. Cladograms based on the morphological and chemical data were performed using Ward's method. The dendrogram based on morphological features revealed that the Iberian Cataglyphis can be classified into three species groups albicans, altisquamis and emmae. The same pattern occurred when the dimethylalkanes constituents of the postpharyngeal gland were utilised as character states, with a slight displacement of species within the altisquamis group. However, when the complete hydrocarbon blend was utilised major discrepancies in the dendrograms occurred. Cataglyphis velox proved to be very similar to C. bombycinus, whereas C. floricola clustered with the other two species of the altisquamis group. Based on the geographical distribution and paleontological data (Tinaut 1993) it is assumed that C. floricola recently invaded the Iberian Peninsula. Based on the chemical findings we postulate that chemical character displacement occurred in C. floricola as a result of its sympatry with C. velox after the former colonized the Iberian Peninsula. We further discuss the possible reason for the different dendrograms obtained when only the dimethylalkanes are considered and its implication for the communicative role of the postpharyngeal gland secretion in these ants.},

	abstract = {The sequencing of the cloned Locusta migratoria mitochondrial genome has been completed. The sequence is 15,722 bp in length and contains 75.3\% A+T, the lowest value in any of the five insect mitochondrial sequences so far determined, The protein coding genes have a similar A+T content (74.1\%) but are distinguished by a high cytosine content at the third codon position, The gene content and organization are the same as in Drosophila yakuba except for a rearrangement of the two tRNA genes tRNA(lys) and tRNA(asp). The A+T-rich region has a lower A+T nucleotide content than in other insects, and this is largely due to the presence of two G+C-rich 155-bp repetitive sequences at the 5' end of this section and the beginning of the adjacent small rRNA gene. The sizes of the large and small rRNA genes are 1,314 and 827 bp, respectively, and both sequences can be folded to form secondary structures similar to those previously predicted for Drosophila. The tRNA genes have also been modeled and these show a strong resemblance to the dipteran tRNAs, all anticodons apparently being conserved between the two species. A comparison of the protein coding nucleotide sequences of the locust DNA with the homologous sequences of five other arthropods (Drosophila yakuba, Anopheles quadrimaculatus, Anapheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, and Artemia franciscana) was performed. The amino acid composition of the encoded proteins in Locusta is similar to that of Drosophila, with a Dayhoff distance twice that of the distance between the fruit fly and the mosquitoes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed the locust genes to be more similar to those of the Dipterans than to those of the honeybee at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels. A comparative analysis of tRNA orders, using crustacean mtDNAs as outgroups, supported this. This high level of divergence in the Apis genome has been noted elsewhere and is possibly an effect of directional mutation pressure having resulted in an accelerated pattern of sequence evolution. If the general assumption that the Holometabola are monophyletic holds, then these results emphasize the difficulties of reconstructing phylogenies that include lineages with variable substitution rates and base composition biases. The need to exercise caution in using information about tRNA gene orders in phylogenetic analysis is also illustrated, However, if the honeybee sequence is excluded, the correspondence between the other five arthropod sequences supports the findings of previous studies which have endorsed the use of mtDNA sequences for studies of phylogeny at deep levels of taxonomy when mutation rates are equivalent.},

The macrocynipoids (i.e. the family Liopteridae and the genera Austrocynips, Eileenella, Heteribalia and Ibalia) are generally large insects that parasitize wood- or cone-boring insect larvae. The microcynipoids are smaller insects that are either phytophagous gall inducers and inquilines (Cynipidae) or parasitoids of larvae of Hymenoptera, Neuroptera or Diptera (Figitidae sensu late, including the families Eucoilidae, Charipidae and Anacharitidae). The phylogenetic relationships among genera of macrocynipoids and between these and a sample of four genera representing the Figitidae and Cynipidae were examined by parsimony analysis of 110 external morphological characters of adults. Within the macrocynipoids, three monophyletic lineages emerged, classified here as different families: the Austrocynipidae, with a single species, Austrocynips mirabilis, the only cynipoid with a true pterostigma; the Ibaliidae, including the genera Eileenella, Ibalia and Heteribalia; and the Liopteridae, comprising the remaining genera of macrocynipoids. The analysis further supported the monophyly of the microcynipoids and indicated that the macrocynipoids form a paraphyletic group relative to the microcynipoids, with the shortest tree suggesting the relationship (Austrocynipidae, (Ibaliidae, (Liopteridae, microcynipoids))). These results imply that cynipoids were originally parasitoids of wood-boring insect larvae and that the other modes of life evolved secondarily within the group.},

	abstract = {A phylogenetic hypothesis of the fungus-growing ants (subfamily Myrmicinae, tribe Attini) is proposed, based on a cladistic analysis utilizing forty-four morphological characters (109 states) of the prepupal worker larva. The fifty-one attine species analysed include representatives of eleven of the twelve currently recognized attine genera, excluding only the monotypic workerless parasite Pseudoatta; the nonattines include two outgroups (species of the basal myrmicine genera Myrmica and Pogonomyrmex), two myrmicine species presumed to be distantly related to the attines, and twelve species representing taxa that have been proposed by prior workers as possible sister groups of the Attini. There is strong character support for the monophyly of the Attini and for a sister-group relationship of the Attini and the Neotropical Blepharidatta brasiliensis, The Attini are divided into two distinct lineages, an `apterostigmoid' clade (containing Apterostigma and Mycocepurus) and an `attoid' clade (containing all other attine genera except Myrmicocrypta). The attine genus Myrmicocrypta appears to be paraphyletic with respect to these two groups; the species M. buenzlii in particular retains many attine plesiomorphies. These results indicate that the fungus-growing behaviour had a single evolutionary origin in the ants. They also indicate that mycelium cultivation is plesiomorphic and that yeast cultivation is derived within the Attini, overturning the long-standing assumption that the yeast-growing Cyphomyrmex species are the most primitive Attini. Behavioural and ecological investigations into the origin and evolution of the fungus-growing behaviour might more profitably focus on species in the attine genus Myrmicocrypta, as well as those in the closely related non-attine genera Blepharidatta and Wasmannia.},

Based either on allele frequencies of loci coding for studied enzymes or on data issued from crossing experiments, Nei genetic distances and reproductive isolation indices were respectively calculated. These values allowed to draw 2 dendrograms suggesting that T. brassicae and T. voegelei are the closest species in the evanescens group. Among two hypothetical cladograms based on morphological characters, one suggests that T. evanescens and T. brassicae are the closest species, and the other is consistent with the preceding constructions.

We further argue that terms like convergence and parallelism are historical sayings and only make sense in a phylogenetic context. Therefore, an approach aiming to produce phylogenetic hypotheses cannot be rejected on the grounds of a high degree of convergence before the actual hypothesis. Convergence is not an empirical observation, but a conclusion made after an analysis. We also discuss the view that knowledge of a character's function is a prerequisite for phylogenetic analysis and conclude that this is an invalid approach. Function, like any other way of sharpening our observations, helps in formulating non-phylogenetic hypotheses of homology, but the crucial test is congruence with other characters on a phylogeny.},

Parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses of the data support monophyly for these social parasites. The trees supporting monophyly are significantly shorter than the trees supporting sympatric speciation of parasites from their hosts. These data support the hypothesis that speciation occurred allopatrically and independently of the evolution of social parasitism. Where the social parasite parasitizes more than one species, the two species used are most closely related to each other. Although social parasites are monophyletic and did not evolve sympatrically from their hosts, it is clear that relatedness among species is important in the host-parasite relation.},

They cannot induce galls; instead their larvae live inside the galls formed by other cynipids. As in many other groups of agastoparasites, there are two competing hypotheses for the evolutionary origin of cynipid inquilines: either they arose from one of their cynipid hosts, and later radiated to exploit other gall-inducing cynipids (monophyletic origin), or they arose repeatedly, each inquiline from its host (polyphyletic origin). These hypotheses for the origin of cynipid inquilines were tested by a phylogenetic analysis of representative species of cynipid gall inducers and inquilines based on adult morphological characters. The analysis supported the monophyly of the inquilines and indicated an origin from gall inducers related to the genus Diastrophus, one of the current host groups. To examine whether the result of the analysis was influenced by convergent similarities among inquilines because of their similar mode of life, all putative apomorphies shared by some or all of the inquilines but not occurring in any of the gall inducers were removed. Despite this, the phylogenetic conclusions essentially remained the same, that is, the support for inquiline monophyly was not caused by convergent evolution. Based on these results, adaptive aspects of the evolutionary origin and maintenance of cynipid inquilinism are discussed, as well as general patterns in the evolution of agastoparasitism.},

Adetomyrma does not possess any of the derived features heretofore said to characterize the existing ant subfamilies. Morphological evidence suggests, however, that it is cladistically a member of the ponerine tribe Amblyoponini despite the absence of apomorphic abdominal characters (tergostemal fusion of abdominal segments 3 and 4) seen in all other Ponerinae and in the more inclusive `poneroid group' of subfamilies. Whether A detomyrma shows primitive absence of such characters or secondary reversal to an unfused state has important implications for the higher phylogeny of the ants.

A second analysis on these better delimited 17 subfamilies resulted in 24 equally most parsimonious trees. All trees showed a basal division of extant Formicidae into two groups, the first containing (Myrmicinae, Pseudomyrmecinae, Nothomyrmeciinae, Myrmeciinae, Formicinae, Dolichoderinae, Aneuretinae) and the second the remaining subfamilies. Clades appearing within these groups included the Cerapachyinae plus `army ants', the Nothomyrmeciinae plus Myrmeciinae, the `formicoid' subfamilies (Aneuretinae + Dolichoderinae + Formicinae), and the Old World army ants (Aenictinae + Aenictogitoninae + Doryline), but relationships within the last two groups were not resolved, and the relative positions of the Apomyrminae, Leptanillinae and Ponerinae remained ambiguous. Moreover, a bootstrap analysis produced a consensus tree in which all branches were represented in proportions much lower than 95\%. A reconstruction of the ground plan of the Formicidae indicated that the most specialized of all recent ants are the members of the subfamily Dorylinae and the least specialized ones are the monotypic Apomyrminae.},

An overall bias in the distribution of A and T bases was observed from all taxa; however, the terebrants (parasitoids) displayed significantly lower AT ratios as well as a higher degree of strand asymmetry. Moreover, a strong positive correlation was observed between relative AT richness and sequence divergence, suggesting selection at the nucleotide level for A and T bases as well as functionality. Overall sequence difference ranged from 2.3 to 53.4\%, with the maximum divergence between members of the two Hymenopteran suborders. These data were used in a phylogenetic analysis to illustrate the utility and degree of resolution provided by this information at various hierarchical levels within this taxonomically diverse order. Parsimony analysis revealed strong evidence for monophyly of the aculeates and the terebrants. Most noteworthy was a strongly supported clade containing the two terebrant superfamilies Icheumonoidea and Chalcidoidea. Conversely, high sequence divergence values resulted in instability at the base of the tree and limited resolution at the higher taxonomic levels.

Two new synonyms are established: Holotachysphex turneri var. transvaalensis (Arnold, 1924) = turneri (Arnold, 1923), and pentapolitanus (de Beaumont, 1960) = mochii (de Beaumont, 1947).},

The wasps appear intermediate in this respect, with some large and widespread clades characterized by little or no phylogenetic variability in queen number. This hierarchy of phylogenetic lability suggests that while ant populations may often be responsive to selection on colony queen number linked with local ecology, bees and wasps appear less responsive in this regard, with a significant element of phylogenetic conservatism involved in the expression of this social trait in the latter two groups.},

Concordance between the genetic and morphological character sets is strong (96\% agreement on identifications), suggesting that recognition of reproductively isolated populations and partitioning of intra- and interspecific variation can in most cases be achieved using appropriate characters of either type in this taxonomically difficult group. Genetic differentiation between native (Argentina) and introduced (USA) conspecific populations of two species, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri, is rather typical of the differentiation existing between conspecific populations found within either country. Furthermore, there appears to have been little reduction of variability (heterozygosity) at enzyme loci following colonization by either species of the United States, although some rare alleles have been lost in the introduced populations. Hybridization is rare between S. invicta and S. richteri where their native ranges overlap in central Argentina, in contrast to the extensive hybridization of these species in the United States, suggesting that prezygotic barriers to gene flow have been compromised in introduced populations. Phylogenetic analysis of the seven species indicates that S. invicta and S. richteri are relatively distantly related within the S. saevissima complex. Given that hybrids between these species in the United States suffer little apparent loss of fitness, genomic incompatibilities generally may be insufficient to create effective postzygotic barriers to interspecific gene flow in this group of ants.},

The genome was 15,779-bp long and contained typical sets of genes [13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs]. The V. ducalis A + T-rich region was 166-bp long and was the shortest of all sequenced Vespoidea genomes, including Vespa. The genome was highly biased toward A/T nucleotides-80.1 \% in the whole genome, 77.8 \% in PCGs, 83.4-85.6 \% in RNAs, and 92.8 \% in the A + T-rich region. These values are well within the typical range for genes and regions of Vespoidea mitogenomes. Start and stop codons in several Vespa species-including V. ducalis-were diversified, despite these species belonging to the same genus. In comparison with the ancestral mitogenomes, Vespa mitogenomes-including that of V. ducalis-showed substantial gene rearrangement; however, we detected no gene rearrangement among Vespa species. We conducted phylogenetic reconstruction based on concatenated sequences of 13 PCGs and two rRNAs (12,755 BP) in available species of Vespoidea-21 species in six subfamilies in two families (Vespidae and Formicidae). The Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood (ML) methods revealed that each family formed strong monophyletic groups [Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) = 1; ML, 100 \%].

	abstract = {. Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are nectar-secreting glands found on plants independent of their flowers. EFNs are diverse in form, present on a wide variety of plants, and their secretions are known to recruit ants. However, much less information has been published on insects with known EFN associations other than ants. Two distinct species groups of OrasemaCameron (Hymenoptera: Eucharitidae) deposit their eggs close to the EFNs of their plant hosts. The simulatrix group comprises six species found in deserts and xeric shrublands of the southwestern United States and Mexico. This species group is revised, retaining O. aureoviridis, O. beameri and O. simulatrix as valid species, and describing O. cancellatasp.n., O. difrancoaesp.n. and O. zahnisp.n. The wayqecha group is from Peru and Colombia and includes the newly described O. wayqechasp.n. and O. quadrimaculatasp.n. Members of the simulatrix group oviposit near EFNs of Chilopsis linearisCav. (Bignoniaceae), Prosopis glandulosaTorr. (Fabaceae), Prosopis velutinaWooton (Fabaceae) and Populus angustifoliaJames (Salicaceae), whereas Orasema wayqecha oviposit on leaves of two species in the family Primulaceae. Monophyly of the two species groups is proposed based on a molecular analysis of ribosomal (28S and 18S) and mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) DNA, morphological features of the adults and planidia larvae, and their shared behavioural association with EFNs. Adults of both species groups have an expanded postgena that encloses the mouthparts, but are otherwise morphologically divergent. The planidia of both groups also share several features, including long cerci that may facilitate their movements within EFNs. Oviposition near EFNs is proposed as a means of increasing encounter rates of the first-instar larvae with their myrmicine ant host; however, it remains unclear whether the planidia are transported directly by the foraging workers of their host Pheidole (Formicidae: Myrmicinae) or indirectly with the help of an intermediate host.

Bayesian and likelihood analyses strongly support reciprocal monophyly for the genera Anochetus and Odontomachus. Additionally, we found strong support for seven trap-jaw ant clades (four in Anochetus and three in Odontomachus) mostly concordant with geographic distribution. Ambiguity remains concerning the closest living non-trap-jaw ant relative of the Anochetus + Odontomachus Glade, but Bayes factor hypothesis testing strongly suggests that trap jaw ants evolved from a short mandible ancestor. Ponerine trap jaw ants originated in the early Eocene (52.5 Mya) in either South America or Southeast Asia, where they have radiated rapidly in the last 30 million years, and subsequently dispersed multiple times to Africa and Australia. These results will guide future taxonomic work on the group and act as a phylogenetic framework to study the macroevolution of extreme ant mouthpart specialization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {AimAn ant parasitoid wasp genus (Eucharitidae: Kapala) common in the New World exhibits the intriguing pattern of having one species distributed widely across tropical Africa and Madagascar. The unusual distribution prompted an investigation of the age, origins and diversification of the Afrotropical Kapala species. We evaluate a previous hypothesis that the species was anthropogenically introduced. LocationAfrica and Madagascar and the Neotropics. MethodsNumerous forms of evidence are incorporated to explain the origin of the Afrotropical species Kapala ivorensis, including phylogenetic relationships, molecular dating estimates, inter- and intraspecific genetic distances, morphology and geography. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using six gene regions (18S, 28S-D2, 28S-D3-D5, ITS2, COI and COII), and network and haplotype analyses were executed with subsets of the data. Two mitochondrial gene fragments were used to calculate divergence times under a strict clock model. Additionally, we tested for a correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance in K. ivorensis populations. ResultsPhylogenetic analysis supports one evolutionary origin of K. ivorensis from within a clade of New World relatives. Network and haplotype analyses of the species show no biogeographical structure, and additionally, there is no statistical phylogeographical signal. These results, in conjunction with the low amount of phenotypic intraspecific variation and the genetic distance to the nearest New World relative, provide sufficient evidence to maintain the Old World Kapala as one species. Estimated mitochondrial mutation rates suggest that this species is over 1Myr old, thus predating any potential for recent human introduction. Main conclusionsMultiple analytical methods indicate the Afrotropical K. ivorensis is molecularly distinct from the Neotropical sister species and originated from a single pre-human dispersal. This is the first dated example of an insect that has colonized Africa via trans-Atlantic dispersal from South America.},

The mitochondrial genome of W. auropunctata harbors a unique gene arrangement the underlines indicate inverted genes) between rrnL and cox1. Phylogenetic analysis largely corroborated the traditional taxonomy, except for L. humile which was found to be more related to those taxa of the subfamilies Formicinae and Myrmicinae than to the consubfamilial Leptomyrmex pallens. Our genomic data can be readily used for genetic assays of these two globally invasive ants.},

Here we document reciprocal shifts in the genomes and transcriptomes of seven fungus-farming ant species and their fungal cultivars. We show that ant subsistence farming probably originated in the early Tertiary (55-60 MYA), followed by further transitions to the farming of fully domesticated cultivars and leaf-cutting, both arising earlier than previously estimated. Evolutionary modifications in the ants include unprecedented rates of genome-wide structural rearrangement, early loss of arginine biosynthesis and positive selection on chitinase pathways. Modifications of fungal cultivars include loss of a key ligninase domain, changes in chitin synthesis and a reduction in carbohydrate-degrading enzymes as the ants gradually transitioned to functional herbivory. In contrast to human farming, increasing dependence on a single cultivar lineage appears to have been essential to the origin of industrial-scale ant agriculture.},

In addition to the mutualistic fungal partner, the colonies of these insects harbor a rich microbiome composed of bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeasts. Previous work reported some Trichoderma species in the fungus gardens of leafcutter ants. However, no studies systematically addressed the putative association of Trichoderma with attine ants, especially in non-leafcutter ants. Here, a total of 62 strains of Trichoderma were analyzed using three molecular markers (ITS, tef1 and rpb2). In addition, 30 out of 62 strains were also morphologically examined. The strains studied correspond to the largest sampling carried out so far for Trichoderma in the attine ant environment. Our results revealed the richness of Trichoderma in this environment, since we found 20 Trichoderma species, including three new taxa described in the present work (Trichoderma attinorum, Trichoderma texanum and Trichoderma longifialidicum spp. nov.) as well as a new phylogenetic taxon (LESF 545). Moreover, we show that all 62 strains grouped within different clades across the Trichoderma phylogeny, which are identical or closely related to strains derived from several other environments. This evidence supports the transient nature of the genus Trichoderma in the attine ant colonies. The discovery of three new species suggests that the dynamic foraging behavior of these insects might be responsible for accumulation of transient fungi into their colonies, which might hold additional fungal taxa still unknown to science.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the phylogeography and historical demography of populations of Acromyrmex striatus (Roger, 1863), a leaf-cutting ant species restricted to the open plains of South America. Additionally, we modeled the distribution of this species to predict its contemporary and historic habitat. From the partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I of 128 A. striatus workers from 38 locations we estimated genetic diversity and inferred historical demography, divergence time, and population structure. The potential distribution areas of A. striatus for current and quaternary weather conditions were modeled using the maximum entropy algorithm. We identified a total of 58 haplotypes, divided into five main haplogroups. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the largest proportion of genetic variation is found among the groups of populations. Paleodistribution models suggest that the potential habitat of A. striatus may have decreased during the Last Interglacial Period (LIG) and expanded during the Last Maximum Glacial (LGM). Overall, the past potential distribution recovered by the model comprises the current potential distribution of the species. The general structuring pattern observed was consistent with isolation by distance, suggesting a balance between gene flow and drift. Analysis of historical demography showed that populations of A. striatus had remained constant throughout its evolutionary history. Although fluctuations in the area of their potential historic habitat occurred during quaternary climate changes, populations of A. striatus are strongly structured geographically. However, explicit barriers to gene flow have not been identified. These findings closely match those in Mycetophylax simplex, another ant species that in some areas occurs in sympatry with A. striatus. Ecophysiological traits of this species and isolation by distance may together have shaped the phylogeographic pattern.},

To date, three ant species, Wasmannia auropunctata, Vollenhovia emeryi, and Paratrechina longicornis, have been reported to reproduce using such reproductive systems. In this study, we reveal that in one lineage of the ant Cardiocondyla kagutsuchi, male and female sexuals are also clonally produced. In contrast to the abovementioned three species, the workers were not only sexually produced but had recombinant sequences in their nuclear internal transcribed spacer regions, although the recombinant sequences were not detected in male or female sexuals.

The pattern of distribution of both organisms reveals that there are varying degrees of host specificity; most ants show broader host usage (promiscuous) but one species (P. dendroicus) is faithful to a single species of Triplaris. In most ant-plant interactions, host usage is not specific at the species level and preferences may result from geographical or ecological sorting.

	abstract = {Aim We sought to reconstruct the biogeographical structure and dynamics of a hyperdiverse ant genus, Pheidole, and to test several predictions of the taxon cycle hypothesis. Using large datasets on Pheidole geographical distributions and phylogeny, we (1) inferred patterns of biogeographical modularity (clusters of areas with similar faunal composition), (2) tested whether species in open habitats are more likely to be expanding their range beyond module boundaries, and (3) tested whether there is a bias of lineage flow from high-to low-diversity areas. Location The Old World. Methods We compiled and jointly analysed a comprehensive database of Pheidole geographical distributions, the ecological affinities of different species, and a multilocus phylogeny of the Old World radiation. We used network modularity methods to infer biogeographical structure in the genus and comparative methods to evaluate the hypotheses. Results The network analysis identified eight biogeographical modules, and a suite of species with anomalous ranges that are statistically more likely to occur in open habitat, supporting the hypothesis that open habitats promote range expansion. Phylogenetic analysis shows evidence for a cascade pattern of colonization from Asia to New Guinea to the Pacific, but no `upstream' colonization in the reverse direction. Main conclusions The distributions of Pheidole lineages in the Old World are highly modular, with modules generally corresponding to biogeographical regions inferred in other groups of organisms. However, some lineages have expanded their ranges across module boundaries, and these species are more likely to be adapted to open habitats rather than interior forest. In addition, there is a cascade pattern of dispersal from higher to lower diversity areas during these range expansions. Our findings are consistent with the taxon cycle hypothesis, although they do not rule out alternative interpretations.},

	abstract = {Animal societies vary considerably concerning how reproductive rights are partitioned among individual group members (”reproductive skew”). Nestmate queens of most polygynous species contribute more or less equally to the brood, but queens of a few species of the genus Leptothorax form dominance hierarchies in which only the top ranking queen lays eggs (”functional monogyny”). As predicted by optimal skew models, high skew appears to be associated with habitat patchiness. Here, we document functional monogyny in the Caucaso-Anatolian ant Leptothorax scamni (Ruzsky 1905). Similar to related species, young female sexuals mate on the ground near their natal nests and thereafter either disperse to found new colonies solitarily or in groups or return into their natal nest, where only one of several co-occurring queens reproduces. A phylogeny of Leptothorax species based on partial CO I sequences corroborates the view that functional monogyny has evolved convergently in several taxa of Leptothorax. It thus is a relatively labile trait that can rapidly adapt to habitat changes.},

However, the two remaining species could not be distinguished from each other on the basis of their venom composition.

Pupae are especially informative, having peculiar bladder-like processes projecting from the ocelli, dorsal mesoscutellum, and laterally from the abdominal tergites. There are also a set of unusual sclerotized bars found laterally on the basal metasomal tergite. Such processes are unknown elsewhere in Hymenoptera. These same pupae offer further insights into the development of the scutellar spines.

The objective of this work was to study the systematics and distribution of Wasmannia in its southern limit of distribution in Argentina. Out of the three species reported so far for Argentina, only W. auropunctata was found to be widely distributed, but abundant only in disturbed habitats mostly in the Northeast.

Wasmannia sulcaticeps and W. williamsoni are much less common and widespread. W. sulcaticepsis mostly found in mountain forests in northwestern Argentina, whereas W. williamsoni is only found in shrublands and grasslands in central eastern Argentina, and most frequently in mountain grasslands.

To better understand vitellogenin in hymenopteran insects, we cloned a cDNA encoding vitellogenin from the hornfaced bee O.cornifrons. Osmia cornifrons vitellogenin cDNA contains 5477bp with an open reading frame of 1783 amino acid residues, and has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 200.21kDa and a pI of 6.55. Osmia cornifrons vitellogenin possesses four consensus (RXXR/S) cleavage sites and has conserved DGXR and GL/ICG motifs in the C-terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the O.cornifrons vitellogenin cDNA showed a 66\% identity with Megachile rotundata, 53\% to Apis mellifera, 51\% to Bombus ignitus and 42\%-30\% with other hymenopteran insect vitellogenins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that O.cornifrons vitellogenin clustered with vitellogenins from Megachilidae, Apidae, Vespidae and Formicidae species but not with those from Pteromalidae, Aphelinidae or Ichneumonidae species. The expression profile of O.cornifrons vitellogenin mRNA during development revealed that O.cornifrons vitellogenin was first detected in the pupal stage and was continuously detected during the adult stage. Interestingly, O.cornifrons vitellogenin mRNA expression was low in mid-diapause, then gradually increased beginning on day3 of the newly emerged adult stage, and subsequently declined. These results suggest that the expression level of O.cornifrons vitellogenin mRNA is stage-specific.},

In this study, we determined the congruence between nuclear simple sequence repeat (SSR, also called microsatellite) genotyping and mtDNA phylogeny to confirm the suitability of the mtDNA phylogeny for inferring the evolutionary history of Decacrema ants. Analyses of ant samples from Lambir Hills National park, northeastern Borneo, showed overall congruence between the SSR and mtDNA groupings, indicating that mtDNA markers are useful for delimiting species, at least at the local level. We also found overall high host-plant specificity of the SSR genotypes of Decacrema ants, consistent with the specificity based on the mtDNA phylogeny. Further, we detected cryptic genetic assemblages exhibiting high specificity toward particular plant species within a single mtDNA clade. This finding, which may be evidence for rapid ecological and genetic differentiation following a host shift, is a new insight into the previously suggested long-term codiversification of Decacrema ants and Macaranga plants.},

We generate and analyse four novel datasets: (i) a robust global phylogeny including 285 Pheidole species, (ii) a global database on regional Pheidole richness in 365 political areas summarizing over 97 000 individual records from more than 6500 studies, (iii) a global database of Pheidole richness from 3796 local communities and (iv) a database of Pheidole body sizes across species. Analysis of the potential climate drivers of richness revealed that the patterns are statistically very similar across different biogeographic regions, with both regional and local richness associated with the same coefficients of temperature and precipitation. This similarity occurs even though phylogenetic analysis shows that Pheidole reached dominance in communities through serial localized radiations into different biomes within different continents and islands. Pheidole body size distributions have likewise converged across geographical regions. We propose these cases of convergence indicate that the global radiation of Pheidole is structured by deterministic factors regulating diversification and diversity.},

	abstract = {Inquiline social parasitic ant species exploit colonies of other ant species mainly by producing sexual offspring that are raised by the host. Ant social parasites and their hosts are often close relatives (Emery's rule), and two main hypotheses compete to explain the parasites' evolutionary origins: (1) the interspecific hypothesis proposes an allopatric speciation scenario for the parasite, whereas (2) the intraspecific hypothesis postulates that the parasite evolves directly from its host in sympatry [1-10]. Evidence in support of the intraspecific hypothesis has been accumulating for ants [3, 5, 7, 9-12], but sympatric speciation remains controversial as a general speciation mechanism for inquiline parasites. Here we use molecular phylogenetics to assess whether the socially parasitic fungus-growing ant Mycocepurus castrator speciated from its host Mycocepurus goeldii in sympatry. Based on differing patterns of relationship in mitochondrial and individual nuclear genes, we conclude that host and parasite occupy a temporal window in which lineage sorting has taken place in the mitochondrial genes but not yet in the nuclear alleles. We infer that the host originated first and that the parasite originated subsequently from a subset of the host species' populations, providing empirical support for the hypothesis that inquiline parasites can evolve reproductive isolation while living sympatrically with their hosts.},

This symbiosis evolved approximately 50-60 million years ago in the late Paleocene or early Eocene, and since its origin attine ants have acquired a variety of fungal mutualists in the Leucocoprineae and the distantly related Pterulaceae. The most specialized symbiotic interaction is referred to as “higher agriculture” and includes leafcutter ant agriculture in which the ants cultivate the single species Leucoagaricus gongylophorus. Higher agriculture fungal cultivars are characterized by specialized hyphal tip swellings, so-called gongylidia, which are considered a unique, derived morphological adaptation of higher attine fungi thought to be absent in lower attine fungi. Rare reports of gongylidia-like structures in fungus gardens of lower attines exist, but it was never tested whether these represent rare switches of lower attines to L. gonglyphorus cultivars or whether lower attine cultivars occasionally produce gongylidia. Here we describe the occurrence of gongylidia-like structures in fungus gardens of the asexual lower attine ant Mycocepurus smithii. To test whether M. smithii cultivates leafcutter ant fungi or whether lower attine cultivars produce gongylidia, we identified the M. smithii fungus utilizing molecular and morphological methods. Results shows that the gongylidia-like structures of M. smithii gardens are morphologically similar to gongylidia of higher attine fungus gardens and can only be distinguished by their slightly smaller size. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of the fungal ITS sequence indicates that the gongylidia-bearing M. smithii cultivar belongs to the so-called “Clade 1” of lower Attini cultivars. Given that M. smithii is capable of cultivating a morphologically and genetically diverse array of fungal symbionts, we discuss whether asexuality of the ant host maybe correlated with low partner fidelity and active symbiont choice between fungus and ant mutualists.},

	abstract = {The rise of integrative taxonomy, a multi-criteria approach used in characterizing species, fosters the development of new tools facilitating species delimitation. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of venom peptides from venomous animals has previously been demonstrated to be a valid method for identifying species. Here we aimed to develop a rapid chemotaxonomic tool for identifying ants based on venom peptide mass fingerprinting. The study focused on the biodiversity of ponerine ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ponerinae) in French Guiana. Initial experiments optimized the use of automated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to determine variations in the mass profiles of ant venoms using several MALDI matrices and additives. Data were then analyzed via a hierarchical cluster analysis to classify the venoms of 17 ant species. In addition, phylogenetic relationships were assessed and were highly correlated with methods using DNA sequencing of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1. By combining a molecular genetics approach with this chemotaxonomic approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the taxonomic findings to reveal cryptic ant species within species complexes. This chemotaxonomic tool can therefore contribute to more rapid species identification and more accurate taxonomies. Biological significance This is the first extensive study concerning the peptide analysis of the venom of both Pachycondyla and Odontomachus ants. We studied the venoms of 17 ant species from French Guiana that permitted us to fine-tune the venom analysis of ponerine ants via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We explored the peptidomes of crude ant venom and demonstrated that venom peptides can be used in the identification of ant species. In addition, the application of this novel chemotaxonomic method combined with a parallel genetic approach using COI sequencing permitted us to reveal the presence of cryptic ants within both the Pachycondyla apicalis and Pachycondyla stigma species complexes. This adds a new dimension to the search for means of exploiting the enormous biodiversity of venomous ants as a source for novel therapeutic drugs or biopesticides.

The gene content and organization correspond to that inferred for the ancestral pancrustacea, except for two tRNA gene rearrangements that have been described previously in other ants. The IGS were highly variable in length and dispersed through the mitogenome. This pattern was also found for the other hymenopterans in particular for the monophyletic Apocrita. These spacers with unknown function may be valuable for characterizing genome evolution and distinguishing closely related species and individuals. NGS provided better coverage than Sanger sequencing, especially for tRNA and ribosomal subunit genes, thus facilitating efforts to fill in sequence gaps.

	abstract = {Gene flow is the main force opposing divergent selection, and its effects are greater in populations in close proximity. Thus, complete reproductive isolation between parapatric populations is not expected, particularly in the absence of ecological adaptation and sharp environmental differences. Here, we explore the biogeographical patterns of an endemic ant species, Cataglyphis floricola, for which two colour morphs (black and bicolour) coexist in parapatry throughout continuous sandy habitat in southern Spain. Discriminant analyses of six biometric measurements of male genitalia and 27 cuticular hydrocarbons reveal high differentiation between morphs. Furthermore, the low number of shared alleles derived from nuclear markers (microsatellites) between the morphs at their contact zone suggests the absence of recent gene flow. Mitochondrial DNA (COI) phylogenetic analysis and median-joining networks show that the black morph is basal to the bicolour morph, with unique haplotypes recovered for each morph. Mismatch distribution analysis and Bayesian skyline plots suggest that they are undergoing different demographic changes, with the bicolour and black morphs at demographic equilibrium and expansion, respectively. Thus, our results show complete reproductive isolation between the two colour morphs as evidenced from genetic, chemical and morphological data. We suggest that these divergence events could be explained by historical vicariance during the Pleistocene, in which reproductive traits experienced strong divergent selection between the morphs initiating or culminating speciation.},

The variance of AT content among species was much higher for the 1st base (AT(1)) compared to the 2nd and 3rd bases, which were nearly invariant. The distance within species was calculated using Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) and it was 0.166, 0.000 and 0.333\% for mean, minimum and maximum, respectively. Moreover, our data also showed some phylogenetic signal. In a neighbor-joining tree for all sequences, two clusters were obtained, the first cluster consisted of subfamilies Formicinae and Myrmicinae, while other clade showed relationship between subfamily Myrmicinae and Ponerinae clustered with subfamily Dolichodrinae, which is not in contradiction with cladistics analysis of morphological data for ants and is consistent with traditional phylogeny of ants.

Our goal was to describe the existence of cytochrome b (cytb) numts in the leafcutter ant Acromyrmex striatus (Roger, 1863). PCR products were directly sequenced using a pair of universal primers designed to amplify the cytb gene of these insects. Other species of leafcutter ants were also sequenced. The sequences were analyzed and the numts were identified by the presence of double peaks, indels and premature stop codons. Only A. striatus clearly showed the presence of numts, while the other species displayed the expected amplification of the mtDNA cytb gene target using the same primer pair. We hope that our report will highlight the benefits and challenges of using mtDNA in the molecular phylogenetic reconstruction and phylogeographic studies of ants, while establishing the importance of numts reports for future studies.

Our analyses indicate that Mycetophylax is monophyletic, as suggested by its morphological characters. M. morschi, previously considered a species of Cyphomyrmex due to a scrobe-like impressed area on the head, forms a well-supported cluster with the two other species of Mycetophylax, M. conformis and M. simplex. Our analysis yields the first comprehensive phylogeny of Mycetophylax based on molecular data and includes specimens from localities within a wide distributional range as well as all species belonging to the genus following the recent taxonomic revision.

The virus, tentatively named Solenopsis invicta densovirus (SiDNV), represents the first DNA virus discovered in ants (Formicidae) and the first densovirus in a hymenopteran insect. The ambisense genome was 5280 nucleotides in length and the termini possessed asymmetrically positioned inverted terminal repeats, formed hairpin loops, and had transcriptional regulatory elements including CAAT and TATA sites. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SiDNV belongs to a group that includes two other densoviruses found in insects (Acheta domestica densovirus and Planococcus citri densovirus). SiDNV was prevalent in fire ants from Argentina but completely absent in fire ants found in the USA indicating that this virus has potential for biological control of introduced S. invicta.

The fungal cultivars of “lower” attine ants are facultative symbionts, capable of living apart from ants, whereas the fungal cultivars of “higher” attine ants, including leaf-cutting genera Atta and Acromyrmex, are highly specialized, obligate symbionts. Since higher attine ants and fungi are derived from lower attine ants and fungi, understanding the evolutionary transition from lower to higher attine agriculture requires understanding the historical sequence of change in both ants and fungi. The biology of the poorly known ant genus Mycetagroicus is of special interest in this regard because it occupies a phylogenetic position intermediate between lower and higher ant agriculture. Here, based on the excavations of four nests in Para, Brazil, we report the first biological data for the recently described species Mycetagroicus inflatus, including the first descriptions of Mycetagroicus males and larvae. Like M. cerradensis, the only other species in the genus for which nesting biology is known, the garden chambers of M. inflatus are unusually deep and the garden is most likely relocated vertically in rainy and dry seasons. Due to the proximity of nests to the Araguaia River, it is likely that even the uppermost chambers and nest entrances of M. inflatus are submerged during the rainy season. Most remarkably, all three examined colonies of M. inflatus cultivate the same fungal species as their congener, M. cerradensis, over 1,000 km away, raising the possibility of long-term symbiont fidelity spanning speciation events within the genus.},

Several explanations for the disparity of biological diversity in the tropics compared to temperate regions have been proposed including that the tropics may act as a museum where older lineages persist through evolutionary time or as a cradle where new species continue to be generated. We infer the molecular phylogenetic relationships of 295 ant specimens including members of all 21 extant subfamilies to explore the evolutionary diversification and biogeography of the ants. By constraining the topology and age of the root node while using 45 fossils as minimum constraints, we converge on an age of 139-158 Mya for the modern ants. Further diversification analyses identified 10 periods with a significant change in the tempo of diversification of the ants, although these shifts did not appear to correspond to ancestral biogeographic range shifts. Likelihood-based historical biogeographic reconstructions suggest that the Neotropics were important in early ant diversification (e.g., Cretaceous). This finding coupled with the extremely high-current species diversity suggests that the Neotropics have acted as both a museum and cradle for ant diversity.},

A notable exception is the wasp family Eucharitidae, which is the only family of insects known to exclusively parasitize ants. Worldwide, approximately 700 Eucharitidae species attack five subfamilies across the ant phylogeny. Our goal is to uncover the pattern of eucharitid diversification, including timing of key evolutionary events, biogeographic patterns and potential cophylogeny with ant hosts. We present the most comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Eucharitidae to date, including 44 of the 53 genera and fossil-calibrated estimates of divergence dates. Eucharitidae arose approximately 50 Ma after their hosts, during the time when the major ant lineages were already established and diversifying. We incorporate host association data to test for congruence between eucharitid and ant phylogenies and find that their evolutionary histories are more similar than expected at random. After a series of initial host shifts, clades within Eucharitidae maintained their host affinity. Even after multiple dispersal events to the New World and extensive speciation within biogeographic regions, eucharitids remain parasitic on the same ant subfamilies as their Old World relatives, suggesting host conservatism despite access to a diverse novel ant fauna.},

	abstract = {Recent molecular phylogenetic studies of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) have revolutionized our understanding of how these ecologically dominant organisms diversified, but detailed phylogenies are lacking for most major ant subfamilies. I report the results of the first detailed phylogenetic study of the ant subfamily Ponerinae, a diverse cosmopolitan lineage whose properties make it an attractive model system for investigating social and ecological evolution in ants. Molecular sequence data were obtained from four nuclear genes (wingless, long-wavelength rhodopsin, rudimentary [CAD], 28S rD-NA; total of similar to 3.3 kb) for 86 ponerine taxa, representing all three ponerine tribes, 22 of the 28 currently recognized genera, and 14 of the 18 informal subgenera of Pachycondyla, a heterogeneous grouping whose monophyly is doubtful on morphological grounds. Phylogenetic reconstructions using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference support the monophyly of Ponerinae and tribe Platythyreini, but fail to support the monophyly of the large tribe Ponerini due to its inclusion of the unusual genus Thaumatomyrmex. Pachycondyla is inferred to be broadly non-monophyletic. Numerous novel generic and suprageneric relationships are inferred within Ponerini, which was found to consist of four major multi-generic clades (the Ponera, Pachycondyla, Plectroctena and Odontomachus genus groups) plus the single genera Hypoponera and Harpegnathos. Uncertainty remains in some regions of the phylogeny, including at the base of Ponerini, possibly reflecting rapid radiation. Divergence dating using a Bayesian relaxed clock method estimates an origin for stem Ponerinae in the upper Cretaceous, a major burst of diversification near the K/T boundary, and a rich and continual history of diversification during the Cenozoic. These results fail to support the predictions of the “dynastic-succession hypothesis” previously developed to explain the high species diversity of Ponerinae. Though model-based reconstructions of historical biogeography and trait evolution were not attempted in this study, the phylogeny suggests that ponerine evolution was marked by regionalized radiations and frequent faunal exchange between major biogeographic provinces. The reported results also imply multiple origins of cryptobiotic foraging, mass raiding behavior, and gamergate reproduction within Ponerinae, highlighting the value of the subfamily as a model for studying the incipient evolution of these and other ecological and behavioral traits.},

These two ant genera have a constant karyotype with a diploid number of 22 and 38 chromosomes, respectively. The most distinct Acromyrmex species from Brazil is A. striatus, which is restricted to the southern states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Several cytogenetic and phylogenetic studies have been conducted with ants, but the karyotypic characterization and phylogenetic position of this species relative to leafcutter ants remains unknown. In this study, we report a diploid number of 22 chromosomes for A. striatus. The phylogenetic relationship between A. striatus and other leafcutter ants was estimated based on the four nuclear genes. A. striatus shared the same chromosome number as Atta species and the majority of metacentric chromosomes. Nuclear data generated a phylogenetic tree with a well-supported cluster, where A. striatus formed a different clade from other Acromyrmex spp. This combination of cytogenetic and molecular approaches provided interesting insights into the phylogenetic position of A. striatus among the leafcutter ants and the tribe Attini.},

The genus was thought to be restricted primarily to the temperate zone, but recent collecting efforts have uncovered a large radiation of Neotropical forms, which rival the Holarctic species in terms of morphological and behavioral diversity. By inferring a broad-scale molecular phylogeny of Stenamma, Branstetter (2012) showed that all Neotropical species belong to a diverse Middle American clade (MAC), and that this clade is sister to an almost completely geographically separated Holarctic clade (HOC). Here, the Middle American clade of Stenamma is revised to recognize 40 species, of which 33 are described as new. Included in the revision are a key to species based on the worker caste, and for each species where possible, descriptions and images of workers and queens, images of males, information on geographic distribution, descriptions of intraspecific variation, and notes on natural history. Several species groups are defined, but the majority of species remain unassigned due to a lack of diagnostic morphological character states for most molecular clades. The following species are redescribed: S. alas Longino, S. diversum Mann, S. expolitum Smith, S. felixi Mann, S. huachucanum Smith, S. manni Wheeler, and S. schmidti Menozzi. The following are described as new: S. andersoni sp. n., S. atribellum sp. n., S. brujita sp. n., S. callipygium sp. n., S. catracho sp. n., S. connectum sp. n., S. crypticum sp. n., S. cusuco sp. n., S. excisum sp. n., S. expolitico sp. n., S. hojarasca sp. n., S. ignotum sp. n., S. lagunum sp. n., S. llama sp. n., S. leptospinum sp. n., S. lobinodus sp. n., S. longinoi sp. n., S. maximon sp. n., S. megamanni sp. n., S. monstrosum sp. n., S. muralla sp. n., S. nanozoi sp. n., S. nonotch sp. n., S. ochrocnemis sp. n., S. pelophilum sp. n., S. picopicucha sp. n., S. saenzae sp. n., S. sandinista sp. n., S. stictosomum sp. n., S. tiburon sp. n., S. tico sp. n., S. vexator sp. n., and S. zelum sp. n.

No males were found from collections from 16 nests, in agreement with previously published data on the other members of this genus, suggesting that males are absent or very rare. The adult females have bilateral symmetry of the head, characteristic dorsal and ventral projections of the putative cheilostom with paired hook-like structures or hamuli, expansive membranous lateral lip flaps or laciniae, gymnostom and stegostom with parallel walls, a swollen procorpus, large terminal bulb with a strong valve, paired ovaries with medial vulva, and a short conoid tail with slender pointed or spicate tip. Scanning electron micrographs of the structure of the head confirmed that the lateral laciniae with finger-like tines or filopodia are moveable (alternately covering and exposing the mouth). These lateral lip flaps are located posterior to the stoma, but anterior to the pore-like amphidial openings. The anterior margin of the cheilostom possesses apomorphic lateral bell-shaped projections and the hamuli are broader and less pointed than other species that have been examined. Molecular phylogeny of near full-length small subunit, D2/D3 expansion segments of the large subunit rRNA gene and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) gene showed that D. formicidae sp. n. is monophyletic with the Diploscapter species and isolates available in GenBank, but is on an independent trajectory supporting separate species status.},

As a result of these circumstances a parallel taxonomy has developed for workers and males, with little or no attempt at integration of the two systems. Molecular markers have the potential to link the two sexes and permit reconciliation of the two taxonomies. Here we analyze a sample of fourteen Leptanilla males from a single site on the island of Rhodes, Greece, using morphology and DNA sequence data (ten nuclear genes; 8.6 kb of aligned sequence data).

In the present study, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus were examined using mitochondrial DNA sequences of the cytochrome b and a part of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6. All 23 Formica species sampled in the Palaearctic clustered according to the subgeneric affiliation except F. uralensis that formed a separate phylogenetic group. Unlike Coptoformica and Formica s. str., the subgenus Serviformica did not form a tight cluster but more likely consisted of a few small clades. The genetic distances between the subgenera were around 10\%, implying approximate divergence time of 5 Myr if we used the conventional insect divergence rate of 2\% per Myr. Within-subgenus divergence estimates were 6.69\% in Serviformica, 3.61\% in Coptoformica, 1.18\% in Formica s. str., which supported our previous results on relatively rapid speciation in the latter subgenus.

Traditional approaches to taxonomy and phylogeny are confounded by multiple factors, including the conservative and often convergent morphology of workers and the rarity of reproductive castes in collections. Monophyly of Stenamma and relationships within the genus are uncertain as nearly all previous taxonomic work has been regional in scope. Furthermore, the sister group to Stenamma has not been well established. Here an extensive molecular dataset consisting of ten genes (similar to 8 kb of data), 48 ingroup taxa (20 Nearctic, 6 Palaearctic and 22 Neotropical) and 8 outgroup taxa (6 closely related non-Stenamma and 2 additional myrmicines) is used to investigate the broad-scale phylogeny and evolutionary history of Stenamma. Phylogenetic analysis is performed under maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks on individual genes and several alternate concatenated datasets, which are used to investigate the effects of inclusion or exclusion of COI and intronic regions. The timing of Stenamma evolution is inferred in beast and ancestral areas are reconstructed using both the s-diva and DEC methods, as implemented in the programs rasp and lagrange, respectively. Stenamma is revealed as monophyletic with high support and tentatively is sister to a group of New World species placed currently in Aphaenogaster Mayr and Messor Forel. Within Stenamma, two major clades are recovered: a Holarctic clade (HOC) and a Middle American clade (MAC). The HOC consists of the European S. striatulum Emery sister to two well-supported groups, the informal debile and brevicorne clades. The brevicorne clade is entirely Nearctic, whereas the debile clade includes both Nearctic and Palaearctic representatives. The MAC occurs from the southern United States to northern South America and, with the exception of S. huachucanum Smith, is almost completely isolated geographically from the HOC. It includes a depauperate northern clade and the MAC core, which is a diverse assemblage of wet forest adapted species found throughout Central America. Divergence dating and biogeographic reconstruction show that Stenamma is most likely to have originated in the Nearctic at the EoceneOligocene boundary (similar to 35 Ma) and diversified more rapidly at 16 and 8 Ma for the HOC and MAC, respectively. Potential environmental factors affecting the evolution of Stenamma include the intense global cooling of the late Eocene combined with aridification and mountain building. The phylogenetic results are discussed in relation to the current Stenamma species groups and several new morphological characters are presented to help in identification.},

It is a candidate for the biological control of cockroaches, but little is known about its basic biology. Here we describe the external morphology of all immature stages of E. appendigaster and compare them with the larvae of related species. The life cycle of E. appendigaster includes three larval instars, each with 13 body segments. Their mouthparts were generally reduced, except for the mandibles, which were always sclerotized and toothed, and were especially robust in second-instar larvae. Antennal and mouthpart sensilla were basiconic and difficult to observe. Larvae of E. appendigaster are similar in form to other described evaniid larvae, but quite different from the two available descriptions of larvae of gasteruptiid and aulacid wasps. Further descriptions of evaniid larvae will be useful in determining how widespread this morphology is within the family, and in understanding phylogenetic relationships within Hymenoptera.},

Centris is also found in the southern portion of the Neartic region, although both genera are more abundant in the humid tropical regions. To describe the structure of the male reproductive system and spermatozoa, light and transmission electron microscopy were used. The male reproductive system of Centris sp. is formed by a pair of testes, a pair of deferent ducts, a pair of seminal vesicles, a pair of accessory glands and an ejaculatory duct connected to the external genitalia, the aedeagus. In this species, testes and the pre-vesicular deferens ducts as well as the seminal vesicles are encapsulated in a single conjunctive capsule, the scrotal membrane. Each testis consists of four testicular follicles, made up of cysts with up to 64 germinative cells. Histologically, the seminal vesicles are formed by a simple cylindrical epithelium, basal membrane and muscular tunic. The spermatozoa of Centris analis, C. fuscata, C. tarsata and Centris sp. are morphologically similar. They have two easily distinguishable regions: the head and flagellum. The head is formed by the two-layer acrosome, the linear nucleus and the flagellum, the centriole adjunct, the axoneme of pattern 9 + 9 + 2 microtubules, two asymmetric mitochondrial derivatives and two accessory bodies. These Centris species share various morphological characteristics of the male reproductive system and spermatozoa with the other bees previously described, indicating that several characteristics are synapomorphic for the family Apidae. Studies on the morphology of the male reproductive system and spermatozoa in Hymenoptera have demonstrated the diversity of the information provided by these reproductive structures, which can be used in taxonomy studies and the phylogeny of this important group of insects.

Here we show for ants and associated fungi in the Cyphomyrmex wheeleri species group that each ant species has been exclusively associated with a single fungal cultivar `species' for millions of years, even though alternative cultivars are readily available, and that rare shifts to new cultivars are associated with ant speciation. Such long-term partner fidelity may have facilitated `tight' ant-fungus coevolution, and shifts to new fungal cultivars may have had a role in the origin of new ant species.},

Queens of the myrmicine ant Vollenhovia emeryi Wheeler exhibit two morphs: a long-winged (L-queen) and a short-winged (S-queen) morph. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among populations of L- and S-queens in V. emeryi and the congeneric species V. nipponica, V. benzai, V. okinawana, and V. yambaru. The molecular phylogeny inferred from mtDNA(approximate to 2,200 nt) showed that S-queens formed a monophyletic clade and that L- and S-queens sampled from the same location did not group together. The phylogeny indicates that wing reduction occurred only once and that S-queen populations are genetically differentiated from L-queen populations, at least in their maternal genomes.

The mt gene arrangement of T. basalis is different from other Proctotrupomorpha mt genomes, with a number of trn genes in different positions. However, no shared derived gene rearrangements were identified in the present study.

In this article, we make a phylogenetic study on several species of the genus Formica and of its closely related genera, Polyergus and Proformica, using sequences of nuclear satellite DNA (stDNA) and the mitochondrial rrnL as molecular markers. Our goal was to shed light on their phylogenetic relationships and particularly on the systematic position of F. subrufa. This species was first included in the subgenus Serviformica, but afterwards a new subgenus (Iberoformica) was established to include only this species. The results show that a stDNA family previously reported in Formica species, with a repetitive unit 129 bp long, is also found in Polyergus rufescens and P. samurai but not in Proformica longiseta. This is the first case of presence of a stDNA family in two different ant genera. In F. subrufa, this stDNA is very divergent relative to those isolated in the remaining Formica species and in the genus Polyergus. The Bayesian analysis of mitochondrial rrnL sequences shows three highly supported groups: F. subrufa, the remaining Formica species studied, and the genus Polyergus, suggesting that parasites (Polyergus species) and hosts (Formica species) are closely related but not sibling species. The combined analysis of nuclear stDNA sequences and mitochondrial rrnL showed their phylogenetic congruence despite their distinct evolutionary dynamics. This analysis did not discriminate between the remaining Formica species that were not grouped according to the subgeneric classification. According to these results, it can no longer be assumed that F. subrufa belongs to the subgenus Serviformica or of the fusca species group. This differentiation was also supported by previous studies based on the morphological characters, molecular and cytogenetic data. Therefore, taking into consideration these arguments and others explained in detail in this article, we propose that the taxon Iberoformica, formerly synonymized subgenus, be raised to a genus status. This genus would be monotypic and only composed, up to the moment, by Iberoformica subrufa (= F. subrufaRoger, 1859).},

Most of the foragers are small (similar to 3.0-5.0 mm), but similar to 10\% of the ants seen foraging are much larger (similar to 7.0 mm) and may form a soldier caste. Foragers are thermophilic and show diurnal activity, displaying a single-peaked activity profile across the day, with activity time limited to 2-6 h at most each day (during the late-summer study period, 28 February to 28 March 2012). They forage largely for dead arthropods, but also occasionally bring home plant materials. Foraging success (not considering possible liquid food intake) is similar to 20\%, resembling the success rate of their congener Melophorus bagoti, which inhabits cluttered environments. When displaced with food from a feeder, the ants head systematically and precisely in the feeder-to-nest direction, thus exhibiting path integration abilities involving celestial compass cues. The study of this species provides an interesting comparative perspective in contrasting desert ants of the same genus and thus genetic heritage inhabiting habitats differing in complexity of panoramic terrestrial cues as well as comparing ecologically similar species inhabiting the same type of habitat (in the present case, salt-pans) but differing in their phylogenetic relationships.},

The polygyny-vs.-polyandry hypothesis argues that polygyny and polyandry should be negatively associated because both can result in increased intracolonial genetic variability and have costs. However, evidence for this long-debated hypothesis has been lacking at the intraspecific level. Here, we investigated the colony genetic structure in the Australian bulldog ant Myrmecia brevinoda. The numbers of queens per colony varied from 1 to 6. Nestmate queens within polygynous colonies were on average related (r(qq) = 0.171 +/- 0.019), but the overall relatedness between queens and their mates was indistinguishable from zero (r(qm) = 0.037 +/- 0.030). Queens were inferred to mate with 1-10 males. A lack of genetic isolation by distance among nests indicated the prevalence of independent colony foundation. In accordance with the polygyny-vs.-polyandry hypothesis, the number of queens per colony was significantly negatively associated with the estimated number of matings (Spearman rank correlation R = -0.490, P = 0.028). This study thus provides the rare intraspecific evidence for the polygyny-vs.-polyandry hypothesis. We suggest that the high costs of multiple matings and the strong effect of multiple mating on intracolonial genetic diversity may be essential to the negative association between polygyny and polyandry and that any attempt to empirically test this hypothesis should place emphasis upon these two key underlying aspects.},

Organisms that rely on asexual propagation risk extinction due to the loss of genetic diversity and the inability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The fungus-growing ant species Mycocepurus smithii was thought to be obligately asexual because only parthenogenetic populations have been collected from widely separated geographic localities. Nonetheless, M. smithii is ecologically successful, with the most extensive distribution and the highest population densities of any fungus-growing ant. Here we report that M. smithii actually consists of a mosaic of asexual and sexual populations that are nonrandomly distributed geographically. The sexual populations cluster along the Rio Amazonas and the Rio Negro and appear to be the source of independently evolved and widely distributed asexual lineages, or clones. Either apomixis or automixis with central fusion and low recombination rates is inferred to be the cytogenetic mechanism underlying parthenogenesis in M. smithii. Males appear to be entirely absent from asexual populations, but their existence in sexual populations is indicated by the presence of sperm in the reproductive tracts of queens. A phylogenetic analysis of the genus suggests that M. smithii is monophyletic, rendering a hybrid origin of asexuality unlikely. Instead, a mitochondrial phylogeny of sexual and asexual populations suggests multiple independent origins of asexual reproduction, and a divergence-dating analysis indicates that M. smithii evolved 0.5-1.65 million years ago. Understanding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of asexual reproduction in this species contributes to a general understanding of the adaptive significance of sex.},

	abstract = {The ongoing molecular revolution in ant systematics, of which Ross Crozier was an early proponent and practitioner, has led to remarkable progress in our understanding of ant phylogeny. In this review I consider the interplay between molecular and morphological evidence, and the integration of molecular phylogenetic results into ant classification. New phylogenetic findings indicate that most ant subfamilies and genera are monophyletic, but there are some significant exceptions, including the subfamily Cerapachyinae and several large and species-rich ant genera (Amblyopone, Aphaenogaster, Camponotus, Cerapachys, Messor and Pachycondyla, among others). These non-monophyletic groups are manifestations of two different phenomena: (1) convergence in morphology and (2) heterogeneity in rates of morphological evolution. Granivorous ants in the genus Messor are an example of the former: molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that the New World and Old World Messor are separate lineages that independently evolved similar derived morphology. Heterogeneity in rates of evolution is exemplified by highly divergent army ants and certain other dorylomorphs - currently assigned to different genera, tribes and subfamilies - that are nested phylogenetically within a group of morphologically plesiomorphic species, most of which are placed in a single genus (Cerapachys). This presents a classificatory conundrum if we wish to maintain a Linnaean (i.e., ranked) classification system in which all named taxa are monophyletic and easily diagnosed. Nevertheless, despite the conceptual appeal of a rank-free classification (as embodied in the PhyloCode), there are practical advantages to maintaining a ranked phylogenetic taxonomy, at least for groups such as ants that are in relatively recent and species-rich branches of the tree of life. These benefits include explicit information about the inclusivity and exclusivity of clades, and identification (through binomial nomenclature) of those taxa that are considered to represent species. It is important to recognize that the assignment of family-group or genus-group rank to clades is arbitrary and that ant taxa of a given rank are not equivalent, except in a very approximate sense. A new modus operandi is emerging in ant taxonomy above the species level, wherein molecular (DNA sequence) data from multiple nuclear genes are used to generate a well supported phylogeny, and the resulting tree serves as a framework for evaluating the informativeness of morphological traits and for identifying (and naming) clades that can be diagnosed morphologically. In following this protocol an attempt should be made to maintain continuity in nomenclature and taxon concepts with the preexisting classification, to the extent that this is possible. A similar set of principles has been followed by plant systematists developing a ranked phylogenetic classification of flowering plants (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system).},

	abstract = {We investigated the genetic structure of 19 colonies of the myrmeciine ant Myrmecia pyriformis SMITH, 1858, using five microsatellite loci. Nestmate relatedness of b = 0.51 +/- 0.04 significantly deviated from the theoretical value of 0.75, which is expected in a monogynous monandrous social system. The occurrence of multiple mating by queens was the most likely explanation in the majority of colonies, and the effective number of male mates was estimated to be 2.60. However, multiple female reproductives were also inferred in some cases. The results correspond well both to observations on promiscuous mating behaviour in the winged sexuals of some species of Myrmecia and to the occurrence of gamergates (mated workers) in M pyriformis. The finding of high levels of polyandry in a species with totipotent workers is discussed with regard to the evolution of eusociality.},

	abstract = {Aim We investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of genetic diversity in West Indian and mainland populations of a widespread parthenogenic ant (Platythyrea punctata F. Smith) to infer source populations and subsequent colonizations across its geographic range. Location Central America, Texas and the West Indies (Florida, the Bahamas, Greater and Lesser Antilles). Methods We employed phylogeographic reconstruction based on 1451 bp of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II) sequenced from 91 individuals of P. punctata. We employed standard population genetic analyses, Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, haplotype networks and molecular dating methods as performed by beast. We also employed phylogenetic analysis using two nuclear markers (970 bp) to understand the placement of P. punctata in the globally distributed genus Platythyrea. Results Based on highly reduced haplotypic variation and temporal estimates, rapid expansion and dispersal from Central America best explains the observed distribution of haplotypes. Platythyrea punctata successfully invaded the West Indies very few times. One haplotype occurred on every island surveyed from the Bahamas and Florida in the north to Barbados at the southern edge of its range. Haplotype diversity in the West Indies is quite low, despite a larger sample size relative to the mainland. Most mainland colonies collected each possessed a unique haplotype, whereas only Florida and the larger islands (the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe) contained more than one haplotype. Island haplotypes were most similar to haplotypes collected in northern Mexico and southern Texas, but genetic distances were nevertheless high. The putative sister species of P. punctata appears to be an endemic of Hispaniola (P. strenua Wheeler \& Mann), even though older, mainland populations of P. punctata are sympatric with at least two other congenerics. Main conclusions Dispersal seems very limited on the mainland, with well-defined clades corresponding to geographical regions. Colonization of the islands from the mainland was extremely rare, but once successful there were very few barriers to expansion to nearly every island in the West Indies. We hypothesize that this invasion occurred during the late Pleistocene as the climate became warmer and less arid.},

Four nests of Mycetagroicus cerradensis near Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil were excavated, and fungus chambers for one were located at a depth of 3.5 meters. Based on its lack of gongylidia (hyphal-tip swellings typical of higher attine cultivars), and a phylogenetic analysis of the ITS rDNA gene region, M. cerradensis cultivates a lower attine fungus in Clade 2 of lower attine (G3) fungi. This finding refines a previous estimate for the origin of higher attine agriculture, an event that can now be dated at approximately 21-25 mya in the ancestor of extant species of Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex.},

	abstract = {Efforts to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) have been boosted in the last few years by accumulation of comprehensive molecular data sets exploring multiple loci on a wide range of taxa within the family. In contrast, the wealth of morphological information for the group remains scattered across the literature comprising more than a century's worth of taxonomic and anatomical research with little standardization. The present study addresses-this problem by providing a synthesis of the external skeletal morphology of ants with special emphasis on the poneromorph subfamilies (Amblyoponinae, Ectatomminae, Heteroponerinae, Paraponerinae, Ponerinae, and Proceratiinae). Particular attention was devoted to documenting and standardizing morphological characters for phylogenetic inference. The morphological analysis was undertaken by constructing a digital atlas of 28 standard views containing 5250 scanning electron micrographs documenting worker ant morphology from which detailed anatomical comparison could be accurately performed. The final matrix describes 139 characters (60\% of which are completely new or coded cladistically here for the first time) for 105 terminals representing similar to 90\% of extant poneromorph genera plus all other extant formicid subfamilies, with the exception of the rare Martilinae, and nonformicid outgroups. This matrix was analyzed with parsimony under both equal weights and implied weights (i.e., where characters are downweighted as a function of their homoplasy). The poneromorph subfamilies form a paraphyletic assemblage with the dorylomorphs, leptanillomorphs, and myrmicomorphs nested inside. All the above subfamilies are in turn reconstructed as nested within a paraphyletic group comprising the formicomophs + myrmeciomorphs. These results are in concordance with traditional precladistic views of the subfamily relationships but are markedly different from current estimates based cm molecular data.},

This study seeks to ascertain whether the spinescence observed among Fijian Pheidole ants was inherited from an oversea ancestor or is evidence of ecological release from interspecific competitors. We broaden our understanding of morphological convergence, insular radiation and Pacific biogeography by testing three hypotheses proposed previously for the Fijian Pheidole roosevelti group: (i) the group is monophyletic; (ii) spinescence is a plesiomorphic trait inherited from an overseas ancestor; and (iii) the group is closely related to spinescent New Guinean relatives. The analysis included the fragments of two mitochondrial genes (COI, cytb) and two nuclear genes (H3, EF1 alpha-F2) from 66 taxa, including all members of the roosevelti group, representatives from the spinescent subgenus Pheidolacanthinus, Fijian congeners and widespread Pacific congeners. Our results yield new insights into the biogeographic history of Fiji, reveal a fascinating example of convergent evolution and serve as a novel example of ecological release occurring within an insular eusocial insect lineage. These findings recover the history of a presumably unremarkable ant species that colonized a remote oceanic archipelago in the Miocene (17-10 Ma) and radiated across the emerging islands into niche-space occupied elsewhere in the Pacific by distantly related spinescent congeners. We propose the radiation of Fijian Pheidole into spinescent morphotypes was the consequence of ecological opportunities afforded by the absence of competing ant lineages with conspicuous epigaeic foraging strategies.},

In the current paper we tested the use of acoustic analysis as a tool to assess the real diversity in a cryptic species complex of Neotropical ants. In order to understand the potential of acoustics and to improve consistency in the conclusions by comparing different approaches, phylogenetic relationships of all the morphs considered were assessed by the analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b. We observed that each of the cryptic morph studied presents a morphologically distinct stridulatory organ and that all sympatric morphs produce distinctive stridulations. This is the first evidence of such a degree of specialization in the acoustic organ and signals in ants, which suggests that stridulations may be among the cues used by these ants during inter-specific interactions. Mitochondrial DNA variation corroborated the acoustic differences observed, confirming acoustics as a helpful tool to determine cryptic species in this group of ants, and possibly in stridulating ants in general. Congruent morphological, acoustic and genetic results constitute sufficient evidence to propose each morph studied here as a valid new species, suggesting that P. apicalis is a complex of at least 6 to 9 species, even if they present different levels of divergence. Finally, our results highlight that ant stridulations may be much more informative than hitherto thought, as much for ant communication as for integrative taxonomists.},

We used mitochondrial sequences of the Cox1, Cox2 and Cytb genes in order to infer some aspects of the evolutionary history and phylogeography of this ant. High genetic divergence and population structure were observed for the whole species. The current pattern of D. lucida diversity seems to be shaped during different geological times: middle Pliocene, early Pleistocene and mainly late Pleistocene, when the reduction of populations generated a structure pattern of the genetic variation of this species. Our data show that this structure results from the maintenance of populations of D. lucida within very small putative refuges to the south of the central Bahia refugium. We thus argue that, for some Atlantic forest endemic species, especially those resistant to very small fragments of forest, such as D. lucida, the small putative refuges were as important as, or even more important than, larger and stable refuges for the creation and maintenance of diversity, adding another piece to the puzzle of the mechanisms underlying local endemism.

Our molecular and morphological results allow us to distinguish two species in the species complex: the species P. chinensis and the new cryptic species P. nakasujii sp. nov., and these two species are widely and sympatrically distributed and abundant in temperate forests in Japan. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis showed that P. chinensis has been introduced into the United States from Japan.

Despite the rapid increase in available mitogenomes, the taxonomic sampling often poorly reflects phylogenetic diversity and is often also biased to represent deeper (family-level) evolutionary relationships. Results: We present the first fully sequenced ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) mitochondrial genomes. We sampled four mitogenomes from three species of fire ants, genus Solenopsis, which represent various evolutionary depths. Overall, ant mitogenomes appear to be typical of hymenopteran mitogenomes, displaying a general A+T-bias. The Solenopsis mitogenomes are slightly more compact than other hymentoperan mitogenomes (similar to 15.5 kb), retaining all protein coding genes, ribosomal, and transfer RNAs. We also present evidence of recombination between the mitogenomes of the two conspecific Solenopsis mitogenomes. Finally, we discuss potential ways to improve the estimation of phylogenies using complete mitochondrial genome sequences. Conclusions: The ant mitogenome presents an important addition to the continued efforts in studying hymenopteran mitogenome architecture, evolution, and phylogenetics. We provide further evidence that the sampling across many taxonomic levels (including conspecifics and congeners) is useful and important to gain detailed insights into mitogenome evolution. We also discuss ways that may help improve the use of mitogenomes in phylogenetic analyses by accounting for non-stationary and non-homogeneous evolution among branches.},

Examination of the amino acid alignment for the RdRp revealed sequence identity {\textgreater}98\% with only nine amino acid changes observed. Seven of these changes occurred in less than 4.3\% of samples, while 2 (at positions 1266 and 1285) were featured prominently.

	abstract = {We reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships within the bacterial genus Pseudonocardia to evaluate two models explaining how and why Pseudonocardia bacteria colonize the microbial communities on the integument of fungus-gardening ant species (Attini, Formicidae). The traditional Coevolution-Codivergence model views the integument-colonizing Pseudonocardia as mutualistic microbes that are largely vertically transmitted between ant generations and that supply antibiotics that specifically suppress the garden pathogen Escovopsis. The more recent Acquisition model views Pseudonocardia as part of a larger integumental microbe community that frequently colonizes the ant integument from environmental sources (e.g., soil, plant material). Under this latter model, ant-associated Pseudonocardia may have diverse ecological roles on the ant integument (possibly ranging from pathogenic, to commensal, to mutualistic) and are not necessarily related to Escovopsis suppression. We test distinct predictions of these two models regarding the phylogenetic proximity of ant-associated and environmental Pseudonocardia. We amassed 16S-rRNA gene sequence information for 87 attine-associated and 238 environmental Pseudonocardia, aligned the sequences with the help of RNA secondary structure modeling, and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships using a maximum-likelihood approach. We present 16S-rRNA secondary structure models of representative Pseudonocardia species to improve sequence alignments and identify sequencing errors. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal close affinities and even identical sequence matches between environmental Pseudonocardia and ant-associated Pseudonocardia, as well as nesting of environmental Pseudonocardia in subgroups that were previously thought to be specialized to associate only with attine ants. The great majority of ant-associated Pseudonocardia are closely related to autotrophic Pseudonocardia and are placed in a large subgroup of Pseudonocardia that is known essentially only from cultured isolates (rather than cloned 16S sequences). The preponderance of the known ant-associated Pseudonocardia in this latter clade of culturable lineages may not necessarily reflect abundance of these Pseudonocardia types on the ants, but isolation biases when screening for Pseudonocardia (e.g., preferential isolation of autotrophic Pseudonocardia with minimum-nutrient media). The accumulated phylogenetic patterns and the possibility of isolation biases in previous work further erode support for the traditional Coevolution-Codivergence model and calls for continued revision of our understanding how and why Pseudonocardia colonize the microbial communities on the integument of fungus-gardening ant species.},

	abstract = {Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are conspicuous organisms in most terrestrial ecosystems, often attaining high levels of abundance and diversity. In this study, we investigate the evolutionary history of a major clade of ants, the subfamily Dolichoderinae, whose species frequently achieve ecological dominance in ant communities. This group has also produced some of the world's most successful invasive ants. We use an extensive molecular data set (similar to 9 kb of sequence data from 10 nuclear genes, covering 48 dolichoderine species and 6 outgroup taxa) to infer the phylogenetic relationships, divergence dates, and biogeographic history of these ants. We evaluate the effects of data partitioning and outgroup composition on phylogenetic inference by estimating relationships under a series of increasingly partitioned data sets and by running analyses both with and without Aneuretus simoni, a rare and localized species that is the nearest living relative of Dolichoderinae. We also examine the effects of excluding 2 data partitions with significant base composition heterogeneity. Our results reveal 4 well-supported and mutually exclusive clades of dolichoderines, corresponding to 4 newly defined tribes: Bothriomyrmecini (B), Dolichoderini (D), Leptomyrmecini (L), and Tapinomini (T). All Bayesian and likelihood analyses yield the same unrooted (ingroup-only) topology, ((D,L),(B,T)), with the outgroups attaching either on the Dolichoderini branch or on the Tapinomini branch. Placement of the root is highly sensitive to choice of model partition and to inclusion/exclusion of Aneuretus. Bayes' factors strongly favor the more partitioned models, and in these Tapinomini is recovered as sister to the remaining dolichoderines, but only if Aneuretus is included. Exclusion of Aneuretus precludes recovery of this topology in all but the most highly partitioned Bayesian analyses and then only with nonsignificant support, underscoring the importance of relict, taxonomically isolated taxa for phylogenetic inference. Removal of 2 partitions with heterogeneous base composition also markedly increases support for placement of the root on the Tapinomini branch. Our divergence date estimates and biogeographic analyses indicate that crown-group dolichoderines arose about 65 million years ago (Ma), although this was preceded by a substantial period (30 million years) of stem group evolution. The 4 extant tribes are estimated to have crown-group origins in the late Paleocene or Eocene (40-60 Ma). Tapinomini and Bothriomyrmecini originated in the Paleotropics and subsequently dispersed to other biogeographic regions. Crown-group Leptomyrmecini arose and diversified in the Neotropics, but they also gave rise to one clade that colonized Australia about 30 Ma and subsequently experienced a massive radiation on that continent. This event occurred later than the diversification of dolichoderines in the northern hemisphere, so that by the time dolichoderines came to dominate the Australian fauna they had already declined in abundance in the Holarctic region.},

This variation is a key reason that the Attini have become a model system for understanding the evolution of complex symbioses. Here, we review the natural-history traits of fungus-growing ants in the context of a recently published phylogeny, collating patterns of evolution and symbiotic coadaptation in a variety of colony and fungus-gardening traits in a number of major lineages.

	abstract = {Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3) is a recently described positive-strand RNA virus that infects the red imported fire ant, S. invicta. The genome of an Argentinean isolate of Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3(ArgSF) ) obtained from the Santa Fe region of Argentina was sequenced in entirety. Assembly of nine overlapping fragments yielded a consensus genome sequence 10,386 nucleotides long, excluding the poly(A) tail present on the 3' end (Genbank accession number GU017972). With the exception of the poly(A) tail, the genome length of SINV-3(ArgSF) was identical to the North American isolate (SINV-3(USDM) ). The SINV-3(ArgSF) genome possessed three major open reading frames (ORFs) (comprised of a parts per thousand yen100 codons) in the sense orientation; SINV-3(USDM) possessed only two. ORFs 1 and 2 had identical start and stop genome positions for both isolates. Blastp analysis of the translated ORF 1 of SINV-3(ArgSF) recognized conserved domains for helicase, protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These domains and their corresponding positions were identical to those reported for SINV-3(USDM) . ORF 2a, unique to the SINV-3(ArgSF) genome, was also found in frame 2 and had a canonical start codon located at nucleotide position 8,351 and a stop codon ending at position 8,827. Blastp analysis of the translated amino acid sequence of ORF 2a revealed no significant similarity in the Genbank database. The two SINV-3 isolates exhibited 96.2\% nucleotide sequence identity across the entire genome. The amino acid sequences of ORFs 1 and 2 exhibited higher identities (99.0 and 98.2\%, respectively) than the corresponding nucleotide regions within the genome. These data indicated that the nucleotide differences between the SINV-3 isolates were largely synonymous. This observation was corroborated by codon substitution rate analysis. Thus, the majority of the SINV-3 codon changes were silent in the two polyproteins, indicating purifying selection pressure on the viral genome.},

	abstract = {Wood ant colonies that appear to consist of individuals representing different species are described in several previous papers. The present study is the first to elucidate the genetic basis of the spectacular morphological variability observed within such colonies. Two seemingly mixed colonies (FM-1 and FM-2) from southern Finland were investigated. On the basis of the morphology of their workers these colonies were comprised of individuals with phenotypes typical of Formica rufa L., F. polyctena Forst., and F. aquilonia Yarr. The sequence of an mtDNA fragment (5' end of the cytochrome b gene) was used to examine the phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes of workers from homogeneous colonies of different wood ant species and the two supposedly mixed colonies, and to sort the individuals within the colonies into matrilines. Six microsatellite loci were used to analyse the genetic differentiation between colonies and among workers within colonies, and to detect putative hybrids. The results show that, independently of their phenotype, workers from the “mixed” colonies were genetically more similar to other individuals in their colony than to those in the homogeneous F. rufa, F. polyctena or F. aquilonia colonies. However, while colony FM-1 consisted of offspring of the same queen or more likely several maternally related queens, colony FM-2 consisted of the offspring of at least four unrelated queens. The data suggest hybridisation between F. polyctena x F. aquilonia and F. polyctena x F. rufa (and possibly subsequent mating between these hybrids) as the most probable mechanism leading to the existence of these two colonies, which implies that the hybrids are fertile. This study shows that colonies of wood ant hybrids can arise spontaneously and persist under natural conditions. The results also revealed that even some morphologically homogeneous colonies are genetically heterogeneous. In the case of closely related, morphologically similar species that interbreed, morphology can be a bad predictor of genetic differences between individuals.},

	abstract = {The palaeotropic genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) is an excellent model system to analyze co-evolutionary processes associated with myrmecophytism, a mutualistic interaction between plants and ants. Ant-plants like Macaranga provide nesting space and feed their partners, whereas the ants protect the plants from herbivores and competitors such as lianas. We used genome-based evidence to investigate speciation mechanisms in Macaranga ant-plants, and their co-evolution with ants from the genus Crematogaster. Our previous work had shown that myrmecophytic Macaranga species show little genetic differentiation, suggesting an adaptive radiation. We hypothesized that the obligatory symbiosis with ants may reduce gene flow among plant populations, eventually enhancing allopatric speciation. To test this hypothesis, we verified the monophyly of the investigated plant lineages by phylogenetic analyses, reconstructed parsimony networks based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation, and assessed population genetic parameters using nuclear microsatellites and cpDNA haplotypes. Our data provided evidence for vicariant events as well as for hybridization and cpDNA introgression among closely related Macaranga species. The extent of population differentiation within myrmecophytic versus non-myrmecophytic species proved to be in a similar range, indicating that our working hypothesis of enhanced allopatric speciation in myrmecophytes cannot be sustained by the present evidence. Nevertheless, the mutualistic interactions of Macaranga and associated ants may be a key innovation that opened an adaptive zone putatively exploited by the divergence of Macaranga.},

We inferred a phylogeny of the Prenolepis genus-group using DNA sequence data from five genes (CAD, EF1 alpha F1, EF1 alpha F2, wingless and COI) sampled from 50 taxa. Based on the results of this phylogeny the taxonomy of the Prenolepis genus-group was re-examined. Paratrechina (broad sense) species segregated into three distinct, robust clades. Paratrechina longicornis represents a distinct lineage, a result consistent with morphological evidence; because this is the type species for the genus, Paratrechina is redefined as a monotypic genus. Two formerly synonymized subgenera, Nylanderia and Paraparatrechina, are raised to generic status in order to provide names for the other two clades. The majority of taxa formerly placed in Paratrechina, 133 species and subspecies, are transferred to Nylanderia, and 28 species and subspecies are transferred to Paraparatrechina. In addition, two species are transferred from Pseudolasius to Paraparatrechina and one species of Pseudolasius is transferred to Nylanderia. A morphological diagnosis for the worker caste of all six genera is provided, with a discussion of the morphological characters used to define each genus. Two genera, Prenolepis and Pseudolasius, were not recovered as monophyletic by the molecular data, and the implications of this result are discussed.

Using an increased sample size for increased robustness of the system, we here delimit the alpine species Tetramorium sp. A sensu Schlick-Steiner et al. (2006) against the co-occurring other Western Palearctic species of the complex. The co-occurring species are T caespitum, T sp. B sensu Schlick-Steiner et al.

In a multi-source approach taking advantage of interdisciplinary complementarity, data from male genital morphology and worker morphometrics, thermal niche and mitochondrial DNA are integrated. The unified species concept is applied using the species-delimitation criteria of phenotypic distinctness, thermal niche divergence, reciprocal monophyly and genetic clusters. Tetramorium sp. A is confirmed to be a separate species. Possible synonyms are excluded as names for it based on biogeographic, thermal-niche and worker-morphometric arguments. Tetramorium sp. A is described as Tetramorium alpestre sp.n. It is known from alpine-mat habitats between 1300 and 2335 m above sea level in Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland. T alpestre is the only Western Palearctic species of the species complex with functionally polygynous nests and supercolonies. Routine identification of workers can be performed using a freely accessible identification tool embedded in the intemet, at http://web-resources.boku.ac.at/Discmean/.

One such parasite, Myrmica microrubra, was recently synonymized with its Myrmica rubra host, because comparisons across Europe indicated insufficient genetic differentiation. Here, we use microsatellite markers to study genetic differentiation more precisely in a sample of Finnish M. rubra and its inquilines collected at two localities, supplemented with mitochondrial DNA sequences. The parasite had much lower genetic variation than the host at three of the four loci studied. Genetic differentiation between the host populations was moderate (F (ST) = 0.089), whereas the parasite populations were more strongly subdivided (F (ST) = 0.440). The host and parasite were highly genetically differentiated both across populations (F (ST) = 0.346) and in strict sympatry (0.327, 0.364), a result that remained robust both in a haplotype network and in PCA ordination. Individual assignments of genotypes indicated that gene flow between sympatric host and inquiline populations is reduced by about an order of magnitude relative to the gene flow within the morphs. Our results suggest that the parasitic morph of M. rubra may be an incipient species, but it remains unclear to what extent the observed genetic differentiation between host and inquiline is due to possible assortative mating and selection against hybrids or to recurrent bottlenecking and genetic drift. We conclude that an explicitly functional species concept would be unambiguous in treating this inquiline as a full species, as it begets its own kind and maintains its integrity in spite of occasional interbreeding with the host.},

As part of the expansion process, distribution patterns and different degrees of geographic isolation among populations of S. saevissima can be observed.

Detection of Wolbachia infection was based on amplification of the 16S rRNA and wsp genes by polymerase chain reactions. Wolbachia was found in only one of the four locations investigated and it was observed that the populations were polymorphic for infection. The infection level observed increased during the period of screening. In particular, double infection (16SWA and B) increased from 44\% in 2005 to 90\% in 2006. The A-group of Wolbachia from the wsp sequences was determined by sequencing. However, two variant wsp sequences were detected in Wolbachia present in these populations. The alignment of our sequences with those deposited in GenBank indicated significant differences in relation to homologous sequences. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using parsimony, and confidence intervals were estimated by bootstrapping. Then the divergence of the Wolbachia of S. saevissima in the populations studied with other variants allowed us to verify that wSS1 and dwSS2 formed a distinct clade within the A-group ({\textgreater} 75\%).

Wingless males of C. venustula use their strong mandibles to kill freshly eclosed rival males and also engage in short fights with other adult males, but in addition show a novel behavior hitherto not reported from social insect males: they spread out in the natal nest and defend “territories” against other males. Ant males therefore show a much larger variety of reproductive tactics than previously assumed.},

One example of such interactions is the insect-driven dispersal of microorganisms, which plays an essential role in the ecology of several microbes. To study dispersal of microorganisms by leaf-cutting ants (Formicidae: Attini), we applied culture-dependent methods to identify the filamentous fungi and yeasts found in two different body parts of leaf-cutting ant gynes: the exoskeleton and the infrabuccal pocket. The gynes use the latter structure to store a pellet of the ants' symbiotic fungus during nest founding. Many filamentous fungi (n = 142) and yeasts (n = 19) were isolated from the gynes' exoskeleton. In contrast, only seven filamentous fungi and three yeasts isolates were recovered from the infrabuccal pellets, suggesting an efficient mechanism utilized by the gynes to prevent contamination of the symbiotic fungus inoculum. The genus Cladosporium prevailed (78\%) among filamentous fungi whereas Aureobasidium, Candida and Cryptococcus prevailed among yeasts associated with gynes. Interestingly, Escovopsis, a specialized fungal pathogen of the leaf-cutting ant-fungus symbiosis, was not isolated from the body parts or from infrabuccal pellets of any gynes sampled. Our results suggest that gynes of the leaf-cutter ants Atta laevigata and A. capiguara do not vertically transmit any particular species of yeasts or filamentous fungi during the foundation of a new nest. Instead, fungi found in association with gynes have a cosmopolitan distribution, suggesting they are probably acquired from the environment and passively dispersed during nest foundation. The possible role of these fungi for the attine ant-microbial symbiosis is discussed.},

Fungus gardens are monocultures of a single cultivar strain, but they also harbor a diverse assemblage of additional microbes with largely unknown roles in the symbiosis. Cultivar-attacking microfungi in the genus Escovopsis are specialized parasites found only in association with attine gardens. Evolutionary theory predicts that the low genetic diversity in monocultures should render ant gardens susceptible to a wide range of diseases, and additional parasites with roles similar to that of Escovopsis are expected to exist. We profiled the diversity of cultivable microfungi found in 37 nests from ten Acromyrmex species from Southern Brazil and compared this diversity to published surveys. Our study revealed a total of 85 microfungal strains. Fusarium oxysporum and Escovopsis were the predominant species in the surveyed gardens, infecting 40.5\% and 27\% of the nests, respectively. No specific relationship existed regarding microfungal species and ant-host species, ant substrate preference (dicot versus grass) or nesting habit. Molecular data indicated high genetic diversity among Escovopsis isolates. In contrast to the garden parasite, F. oxysporum strains are not specific parasites of the cultivated fungus because strains isolated from attine gardens have similar counterparts found in the environment. Overall, the survey indicates that saprophytic microfungi are prevalent in South American leafcutter ants. We discuss the antagonistic potential of these microorganisms as “weeds” in the ant-fungus symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Trap-jaw ants of the genus Odontomachus produce remarkably fast predatory strikes. The closing mandibles of Odontomachus bauri, for example, can reach speeds of over 60 ms(-1). They use these jaw strikes for both prey capture and locomotion - by striking hard surfaces, they can launch themselves into the air. We tested the hypothesis that morphological variation across the genus is correlated with differences in jaw speeds and accelerations. We video-recorded jaw- strikes at 70 000 - 100 000 frames s(-1) to measure these parameters and to model force production. Differences in mean speeds ranged from 35.9 +/- 7.7 m s(-1) for O. chelifer, to 48.8 +/- 8.9ms(-1) for O. clarus desertorum. Differences in species' accelerations and jaw sizes resulted in maximum strike forces in the largest ants ( O. chelifer) that were four times those generated by the smallest ants ( O. ruginodis). To evaluate phylogenetic effects and make statistically valid comparisons, we developed a phylogeny of all sampled Odontomachus species and seven outgroup species ( 19 species total) using four genetic loci. Jaw acceleration and jaw- scaling factors showed significant phylogenetic non- independence, whereas jaw speed and force did not. Independent contrast ( IC) values were used to calculate scaling relationships for jaw length, jaw mass and body mass, which did not deviate significantly from isometry. IC regression of angular acceleration and body size show an inverse relationship, but combined with the isometric increase in jaw length and mass results in greater maximum strike forces for the largest Odontomachus species. Relatively small differences (3\%) between IC and species-mean based models suggest that any deviation from isometry in species' force production may be the result of recent selective evolution, rather than deep phylogenetic signal.},

Our analyses indicate that the original form of ant agriculture, the cultivation of a diverse subset of fungal species in the tribe Leucocoprineae, evolved approximate to 50 million years ago in the Neotropics, coincident with the early Eocene climatic optimum. During the past 30 million years, three known ant agricultural systems, each involving a phylogenetically distinct set of derived fungal cultivars, have separately arisen from the original agricultural system. One of these derived systems subsequently gave rise to the fifth known system of agriculture, in which a single fungal species is cultivated by leaf-cutter ants. Leaf-cutter ants evolved remarkably recently (approximate to 8-12 million years. ago) to become the dominant herbivores of the New World tropics. Our analyses identify relict, extant attine ant species that occupy phylogenetic positions that are transitional between the agricultural systems. Intensive study of those species holds particular promise for clarifying the sequential accretion of ecological and behavioral characters that produced each of the major ant agricultural systems.},

However, the latter is of major importance for ant relationships, as it is considered the most basal subfamily. Therefore, each new discovery of a Mesozoic ant is of high interest for improving our understanding of their early history and basal relationships. In this paper, a new sphecomyrmine ant, allied to the Burmese amber genus Haidomyrmex, is described from mid-Cretaceous amber of France as Haidomyrmodes mammuthus gen. and sp. n. The diagnosis of the tribe Haidomyrmecini is emended based on the new type material, which includes a gyne (alate female) and two incomplete workers. The genus Sphecomyrmodes, hitherto known by a single species from Burmese amber, is also reported and a new species described as S. occidentalis sp. n. after two workers remarkably preserved in a single piece of Early Cenomanian French amber. The new fossils provide additional information on early ant diversity and relationships and demonstrate that the monophyly of the Sphecomyrminae, as currently defined, is still weakly supported.},

	abstract = {Symbiont choice has been proposed to play an important role in shaping many symbiotic relationships, including the fungus-growing ant-microbe mutualism. Over millions of years, fungus-growing ants have defended their fungus gardens from specialized parasites with antibiotics produced by an actinomycete bacterial mutualist (genus Pseudonocardia). Despite the potential of being infected by phylogenetically diverse strains of parasites, each ant colony maintains only a single Pseudonocardia symbiont strain, which is primarily vertically transmitted between colonies by the founding queens. In this study, we show that Acromyrmex leaf-cutter ants are able to differentiate between their native actinomycete strain and a variety of foreign strains isolated from sympatric and allopatric Acromyrmex species, in addition to strains originating from other fungus-growing ant genera. The recognition mechanism is sufficiently sensitive for the ants to discriminate between closely related symbiont strains. Our findings suggest that symbiont recognition may play a crucial role in the fungus-growing ant-bacterium mutualism, likely allowing the ants to retain ecological flexibility necessary for defending their garden from diverse parasites and, at the same time, resolve potential conflict that can arise from rearing competing symbiont strains.},

We reconstruct a time frame for the ants' diversification and demographic expansions, and identify areas that might have been refugia or centres of diversification. Seventeen operational lineages are identified, most of which can be distinguished by host preference and geographical range. The ants first diversified 16-20 Ma, not long after the onset of the everwet forests in Sundaland, and achieved most of their taxonomic diversity during the Pliocene. Pleistocene demographic expansions are inferred for several of the younger lineages. Phylogenetic relationships suggest a Bornean cradle and major axis of diversification. Taxonomic diversity tends to be associated with mountain ranges; in Borneo, it is greatest in the Crocker Range of Sabah and concentrated also in other parts of the northern northwest coast. Within-lineage genetic diversity in Malaya and Sumatra tends to also coincide with mountain ranges. A series of disjunct and restricted distributions spanning northern northwest Borneo and the major mountain ranges of Malaya and Sumatra, seen in three pairs of sister lineages, further suggests that these regions were rain-forest refuges during drier climatic phases of the Pleistocene.

Previous phylogenetic studies based on limited samplings of Decacrema present conflicting reconstructions of the evolutionary history of the association, inferring both cospeciation and the predominance of host shifts. We use cytochrome oxidase I (COI) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships in a comprehensive sampling of the Decacrema inhabitants of Macaranga. Using a published Macaranga phylogeny, we test whether the ants and plants have cospeciated. The COI phylogeny reveals 10 well-supported lineages and an absence of cospeciation. Host shifts, however, have been constrained by stem traits that are themselves correlated with Macaranga phylogeny. Earlier lineages of Decacrema exclusively inhabit waxy stems, a basal state in the Pachystemon clade within Macaranga, whereas younger species of Pachystemon, characterized by nonwaxy stems, are inhabited only by younger lineages of Decacrema. Despite the absence of cospeciation, the correlated succession of stem texture in both phylogenies suggests that Decacrema and Pachystemon have diversified in association, or codiversified. Subsequent to the colonization of the Pachystemon clade, Decacrema expanded onto a second clade within Macaranga, inducing the development of myrmecophytism in the Pruinosae group. Confinement to the aseasonal wet climate zone of western Malesia suggests myrmecophytic Macaranga are no older than the wet forest community in Southeast Asia, estimated to be about 20 million years old (early Miocene). Our calculation of COI divergence rates from several published arthropod studies that relied on tenable calibrations indicates a generally conserved rate of approximately 1.5\% per million years. Applying this rate to a rate-smoothed Bayesian chronogram of the ants, the Decacrema from Macaranga are inferred to be at least 12 million years old (mid-Miocene). However, using the extremes of rate variation in COI produces an age as recent as 6 million years. Our inferred timeline based on 1.5\% per million years concurs with independent biogeographical events in the region reconstructed from palynological data, thus suggesting that the evolutionary histories of Decacrema and their Pachystemon hosts have been contemporaneous since the mid-Miocene. The evolution of myrmecophytism enabled Macaranga to radiate into enemy-free space, while the ants' diversification has been shaped by stem traits, host specialization, and geographic factors. We discuss the possibility that the ancient and exclusive association between Decacrema and Macaranga was facilitated by an impoverished diversity of myrmecophytes and phytoecious (obligately plant inhabiting) ants in the region.},

The relatedness of inquilines to their hosts has been generalized in Emery's rule, suggesting that social parasites are close or the closest relatives to their host species. If the closest relative of each parasite is its host, then multiple independent origins of the parasite species are implied even within a single genus, probably through sympatric speciation. To test the plausibility of sympatric speciation in inquilines, we conducted a mitochondrial DNA phylogenetic analysis in three inquiline-host pairs of Myrmica ant species. We show that congeneric inquilines have originated independently several times. We also show that two of the inqulines are more closely related to their hosts than to any other species. Our results suggest sympatric speciation of Myrmica inquilines. Sympatric speciation is probably facilitated by the social biology and ecology of Myrmica, with polygyny as a prerequisite for the evolution of intraspecific parasitism.},

This vertical cultivar transmission between generations is thought to result in long-term ant-fungus coevolution and selection for beneficial cultivar traits that maximize harvests and thus colony productivity. In contrast to this traditional view of vertical cultivar transmission, frequent horizontal cultivar transmission between ant species is implicated by a phylogenetic analysis of 72 cultivars propagated by two fungus-growing ant species coexisting sympatrically in central Panama. The two ant species are specialized on the same group of closely related cultivars, but in six of 12 cultivar clades identifiable within this group, cultivars from both ant species were united in the same clade. Five of these `mixed' clades were supported by bootstrap values of about 90\% or higher. In one instance, colonies from the two ant species cultivated the same, genetically identical, cultivar clone. These phylogenetic patterns indicate that: (i) cultivar exchanges between the two ant species occur routinely throughout ecological time; and that (ii) coevolutionary processes between ants and their fungi are more diffuse than previously assumed. Because the two ant species are specialized on a narrow group of closely related cultivars that they regularly exchange among each other, but not with other sympatric ant species, cultivar exchanges are constrained, most likely, by ant preferences for their own cultivar group or by stringent selection against transitions of ant lineages to distantly related cultivars.},

	doi = {10.1086/393867},
	abstract = {Cultivation of fungus for food originated about 45-65 million years ago in the ancestor of fungus-growing ants (Formicidae, tribe Attini), representing an evolutionary transition from the life of a hunter-gatherer of anthropod prey, nectar, and other plant juices, to the life of a farmer subsisting on cultivated fungi. Seven hypotheses have been suggested for the origin of attine fungiculture, each differing with respect to the substrate used by the ancestral attine ants for fungal cultivation. Phylogenetic information on the cultivated fungi, in conjunction with information on the nesting biology of extant attine ants and their presumed closest relatives, reveal that the attine ancestors probably did not encounter their cultivars-to-be in seed stores (von Ihering 1894), in rotting wood (Forel 1902), as mycorrhizae (Garling 1979), an arthropod corpses (von Ihering 1894) or ant faeces in nest middens (Wheeler 1907). Rather, the attine ant-fungus mutualism probably arose from adventitious interactions with fungi that grew on walls of nests built in leaf litter (Emery 1899), or from a system of fungal myrmecochory in which specialized fungi relied on ants for dispersal (Bailey 1920) and in which the ants fortuitously vectored these fungi from parent to offspring nests prior to a true fungicultural stage. Reliance on fungi as a dominant food source has evolved only twice in ants: first in the attine ants, and second in some ant species in the solenopsidine genus Megalomyrmex that either coexist as trophic parasites in gardens of attine hosts or aggressively usurp gardens from them. All other known ant-fungus associations are either adventitious or have nonnutritional functions (e.g. strengthening of carton-walls in ant nests). There exist no unambiguous reports of facultative mycophagy in ants, but such trophic ant-fungus interactions would most likely occur underground or in leaf litter and thus escape easy observation. Indirect evidence of fungivory can be deduced from contents of the ant alimentary canal and particularly from the contents of the infrabuccal pocket, a pharyngeal device that filters out solids before liquids pass into the intestine. Infrabuccal pocket contents reveal that ants routinely ingest fungal spores and hyphal material. Infrabuccal contents are eventually expelled as a pellet on nest middens or away from the nest by foragers, suggesting that the pellet provides fungi with a means for the dispersal of spores and hyphae. Associations between such “buccophilous” fungi and ants may have originated multiple times and may have become elaborated and externalized in the case of the attine ant-fungus mutualism. Thus, contrary to the traditional model in which attine fungi are viewed as passive symbionts that happened to come under ant control, this alternative model of a myrmecochorous origin of the attine mutualism attributes an important role to evolutionary modifications of the fungi that preceded the ant transition from hunter-gatherer to fungus farmer.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships of corbiculate bees have been a well-known focus of controversies over the past 30 years. The majority of the morphological datasets support the monophyly of Apina + Meliponina, whereas molecular datasets recover Meliponina as sister to Bombina. This issue is especially critical to the proper understanding of the evolution of clusters of traits that define the corbiculate eusocial behaviour. This work provides a description and discussion on characters of the head capsule, mandibles and sitophore of bees. Thirty-three characters are proposed and optimized within concurrent phylogenetic hypotheses for corbiculate bees, which results in seven derived character-states supporting the monophyly of the Apina + Meliponina + Bombina and nine supporting the Apina + Meliponina clades. Although some striking synapomorphies (e.g. tentorial bridge, pleurostomal condyle, hypopharyngeal lobe) support the former clade, most characters supporting the latter (i.e. Apina + Meliponina) were losses/reductions. Moreover, two previously undescribed character transformations on hypostoma and sitophore favour the Bombina + Meliponina clade. Internal head capsule characters are useful for phylogenetic analysis in comparative studies of bees, and corbiculate bees in particular, when efforts are made to solve the corbiculate controversy'. An attempt is made to standardize the current terminology used for bees and for other Hymenoptera.},

	abstract = {Spider wasps (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae) constitute a monophyletic family supported by numerous morphological and behavioural traits. The subfamilial and tribal classifications, however, have a history of conflicting and confusing designations and nomenclature. Here, we reconstruct a molecular phylogeny of Pompilidae from Bayesian and maximum-likelihood analyses of four nuclear molecular markers (elongation factor-1 alpha F2 copy, long-wavelength rhodopsin, RNA polymerase II, and 28S ribosomal RNA). A Bayesian divergence-time estimation analysis was performed using four calibration points and an ancestral-area reconstruction was performed with a Bayesian binary Markov chain Monte Carlo method. New relationships are recovered, and new subfamilial delimitations are proposed and discussed based on the phylogeny. The origin of Pompilidae was c. 43.3 Mya, probably in the Nearctic region. Most of the extant subfamilies originated from the late Eocene to the Oligocene, and their current distributions are the product of various dispersal events that occurred over the course of similar to 40 Mya. This is the first phylogenetic reconstruction of Pompilidae from molecular characters, with broad geographical and taxonomic sampling. The following subfamilies and relationships are recognized: Ctenocerinae + ((Ceropalinae + Notocyphinae) + (Pompilinae + Pepsinae)). We revalidate Notocyphinae, which contains only Notocyphus, and define a new tribe in Pompilinae: Sericopompilini. Priochilini is reinstated. Sericopompilini contains Sericopompilus as the sole representative; Priochilini contains Priochilus and Balboana. Epipompilus and Chirodamus are now classified as Pepsinae.

This topology is consistent with most studies that use morphological data and the few that use behavioural data, which suggests that advanced eusociality arose only once in a common ancestor of the clade Apina plus Meliponina; however, this hypothesis is inconsistent with our molecular data.

Any such differences will affect ecosystem assembly. Thus, it is important to understand why unequal dispersal rates might occur. Recent studies have indicated strong differences between forward and backward dispersal in two major bee groups, Hylaeinae and Allodapini. Here, we use a third bee group, tribe Ceratinini, to determine whether this might be a more general phenomenon. LocationWorldwide. MethodsCeratinini is globally distributed (excepting Antarctica) and contains the single genus Ceratina and 21 subgenera, most of which are endemic to continents. We examined the phylogeny of Ceratinini using sequence data from three genes and 99 species, and inferred ancestral distributions using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. ResultsWe show that the tribe Ceratinini had an African origin in the early Eocene. This was followed by four dispersals out of Africa in the Eocene and early Oligocene and three further dispersals between the Miocene and the present. There has been no back-dispersal of Ceratinini to Africa. The lack of back-dispersal cannot be explained by species abundance in non-African regions, and physical barriers to back-dispersal seem unlikely. Main conclusionsOur results are similar to findings for two other major bee groups and indicate that back-dispersal is very rare. It is unlikely that physical barriers can explain these patterns. However, dispersal patterns might be explained by assembly rules such as niche pre-emption or by reduced opportunities for escaping into enemy-free space. At a continental level, it is likely that the composition of bee fauna is more strongly influenced by very early dispersal events rather than by later physical barriers to dispersal.},

Here, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of Cephalonomia gallicola (Chrysidoidea: Bethylidae) and Wallacidia oculata (Vespoidea: Mutillidae). In Cephalonomia at least 11 tRNA and 2 protein-coding genes were rearranged, which is the first report of protein-coding gene rearrangements in the Aculeata. In the Hymenoptera, three types of protein-coding gene rearrangement events occur, i.e. reversal, transposition and reverse transposition. Venturia (Ichneumonidae) had the greatest number of common intervals with the ancestral gene arrangement pattern, whereas Philotrypesis (Agaonidae) had the fewest. The most similar rearrangement patterns are shared between Nasonia (Pteromalidae) and Philotrypesis, whereas the most differentiated rearrangements occur between Cotesia (Braconidae) and Philotrypesis. It is clear that protein-coding gene rearrangements in the Hymenoptera are evolutionarily independent across the major lineages but are conserved within groups such as the Chalcidoidea. Phylogenetic analyses supported the sister-group relationship of Orrussoidea and Apocrita, Ichneumonoidea and Aculeata, Vespidae and Apoidea, and the paraphyly of Vespoidea. The Evaniomorpha and phylogenetic relationships within Aculeata remain controversial, with discrepancy between analyses using protein-coding and RNA genes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Less researched are insects, even though these specimens frequently serve as the most valuable paleoenvironemental indicators due to their narrow climate restrictions and life cycles. Our goal was to examine fossil material that included insect-plant associations, and thus an even higher potential for significant paleoenviromental data. Micro-CT scans of two exceptionally preserved leafcutter bee nest cells from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California reveal intact pupae dated between, similar to 23,000-40,000 radiocarbon years BP. Here identified as best matched to Megachile (Litomegachile) gentilis Cresson (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) based on environmental niche models as well as morphometrics, the nest cells (LACMRLP 388E) document rare preservation and life-stage. The result of complex plant-insect interactions, they offer new insights into the environment of the Late Pleistocene in southern California. The remarkable preservation of the nest cells suggests they were assembled and nested in the ground where they were excavated. The four different types of dicotyledonous leaves used to construct the cells were likely collected in close proximity to the nest and infer a wooded or riparian habitat with sufficient pollen sources for larval provisions. LACMRLP 388E is the first record of fossil Megachile Latreille cells with pupae. Consequently, it provides a pre-modern age location for a Nearctic group, whose phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic history remain poorly understood. Megachile gentilis appears to respond to climate change as it has expanded its distribution across elevation gradients over time as estimated by habitat suitability comparisons between low and high elevations; it currently inhabits mesic habitats which occurred at a lower elevation during the Last Glacial Maximum,21,000 years ago. Nevertheless, the broad ecological niche of M. gentilis appears to have remained stable.},

We inferred the phylogeny of 21 Osmia species belonging to this clade by applying Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods based on five genes and morphology. Because our results revealed paraphyly of the largest subgenus (Osmia s.s.), we synonymized Monosmia and Orientosmia under Osmia s.s.

Polylecty appears to be the ancestral state, with oligolectic lineages having evolved twice independently. Among the polylectic species, several intriguing patterns of host plant use were found, suggesting that host plant choice of these bees is constrained to different degrees and governed by flower morphology, pollen chemistry or nectar availability, thus supporting previous findings on predominantly oligolectic clades of bees.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 111, 78-91.},

Phylogeny is crucial to understanding the evolution of the salient features of these insects, including eusociality [5]. Yet the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of aculeate Hymenoptera remain contentious [6-12]. We address this problem here by generating and analyzing genomic data for a representative series of taxa. We obtain a single well-resolved and strongly supported tree, robust to multiple methods of phylogenetic inference. Apoidea (spheciform wasps and bees) and ants are sister groups, a novel finding that contradicts earlier views that ants are closer to ectoparasitoid wasps. Vespid wasps (paper wasps, yellow jackets, and relatives) are sister to all other aculeates except chrysidoids. Thus, all eusocial species of Hymenoptera are contained within two major groups, characterized by transport of larval provisions and nest construction, likely prerequisites for the evolution of eusociality. These two lineages are interpolated among three other clades of wasps whose species are predominantly ectoparasitoids on concealed hosts, the inferred ancestral condition for aculeates [2]. This phylogeny provides a new framework for exploring the evolution of nesting, feeding, and social behavior within the stinging Hymenoptera.},

Our taxon sampling places special attention on North American members of the subgenus Melanosmia Schmiedeknecht; we discuss the novel placement of a number of species traditionally assigned to O.

We use this new phylogeny to guide a reassessment of morphological and behavioural characters within Osmia.

We additionally propose nigrifrons species group' for a clade within O. (Melanosmia) containing most species formerly placed in Osmia (Centrosmia) Robertson. We demonstrate more cohesive patterns of nest substrate use in the nigrifrons and odontogaster species groups than was previously believed to occur, reconsider character polarity of aspects of the female mandible, and show that a large number of morphological characters have evolved convergently within the genus.

Compared to the current morphology-based classification, our phylogeny resulted in three classificatory changes: first, the subgenera Alcidamea, Cyrtosmia, Dasyosmia, Megalosmia, Monumetha, and Prionohoplitis are merged into one large subgenus Alcidamea Cresson, 1864, comb. nov.; second, the subgenera Annosmia, Bytinskia, Coloplitis, and Hoplitis are merged into one large subgenus Hoplitis Klug, 1807, comb. nov.; third, the subgenera Acrosmia, Hoplitina, Penteriades, and Proteriades are merged into one large subgenus Proteriades Titus, 1904, comb. nov.

The species of the genus Hoplitis exhibit an extraordinary diversity in nesting behaviour, comprising both below and above ground nesting.

Zoologica Scripta, 41, 527535. The hymenopteran superfamily Apoidea includes the bees (Anthophila) as well as four predatory wasp families (Heterogynaidae, Ampulicidae, Sphecidae and Crabronidae) collectively referred to as the sphecoid or apoid wasps. The most widely cited studies suggest that bees are sister to the wasp family Crabronidae, but alternative hypotheses have been proposed based on both morphological and molecular data. We combined DNA sequence data from previously published studies and newly generated data for four nuclear genes (28S, long-wavelength rhodopsin, elongation factor-1a and wingless) to identify the likely sister group to the bees. Analysis of our four-gene data set by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods indicates that bees most likely arise from within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. Possible sister groups to the bees include Philanthinae, Pemphredoninae or Philanthinae + Pemphredoninae. We used Bayesian methods to explore the robustness of our results. Bayes Factor tests strongly rejected the hypotheses of crabronid monophyly as well as placement of Heterogynaidae within Crabronidae. Our results were also stable to alternative rootings of the bees. These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that bees arise from within Crabronidae, rather than being sister to Crabronidae, thus altering our understanding of bee ancestry and evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships within the bee family Megachilidae are poorly understood. The monophyly of the subfamily Fideliinae is questionable, the relationships among the tribes and subtribes in the subfamily Megachilinae are unknown, and some extant genera cannot be placed with certainty at the tribal level. Using a cladistic analysis of adult external morphological characters, we explore the relationships of the eight tribes and two subtribes currently recognised in Megachilidae. Our dataset included 80\% of the extant generic-level diversity, representatives of all fossil taxa, and was analysed using parsimony. We employed 200 characters and selected 7 outgroups and 72 ingroup species of 60 genera, plus 7 species of 4 extinct genera from Baltic amber. Our analysis shows that Fideliinae and the tribes Anthidiini and Osmiini of Megachilinae are paraphyletic; it supports the monophyly of Megachilinae, including the extinct taxa, and the sister group relationship of Lithurgini to the remaining megachilines. The Sub-Saharan genus Aspidosmia, a rare group with a mixture of osmiine and anthidiine features, is herein removed from Anthidiini and placed in its own tribe, Aspidosmiini, new tribe. Protolithurgini is the sister of Lithurgini, both placed herein in the subfamily Lithurginae; the other extinct taxa, Glyptapina and Ctenoplectrellina, are more basally related among Megachilinae than Osmiini, near Aspidosmia, and are herein treated at the tribal level. Noteriades, a genus presently in the Osmiini, is herein transferred to the Megachilini. Thus, we recognise four subfamilies (Fideliinae, Pararhophitinae, Lithurginae and Megachilinae) and nine tribes in Megachilidae. We briefly discuss the evolutionary history and biogeography of the family, present alternative classifications, and provide a revised key to the extant tribes of Megachilinae.},

The history of work on the Randeck Maar is briefly reviewed and these fossils placed into context with other Tertiary and living species of the genus Apis Linnaeus (Apinae: Apini). Previously unrecorded specimens from Randeck Maar were compared with earlier series in an attempt to evaluate the observed variation. A morphometric analysis of forewing venation angles across representative Recent and Tertiary species of Apis as well as various non-Apini controls was undertaken to evaluate the distribution of variation in fossil honey bees. The resulting dendrogram shows considerable variation concerning the wing venation of Miocene Apini, but intergradation of other morphological characters reveals no clear pattern of separate species. This suggests that a single, highly variable species was present in Europe during the Miocene. The pattern also supports the notion that the multiple species and subspecies proposed by earlier authors for the Randeck Maar honey bee fauna are not valid, and all are accordingly recognized as Apis armbrusteri Zeuner.},

However, robust phylogenetic data at generic and species level are now needed for all melittid clades to test these hypotheses and investigate early melittid and bee evolution in general. The bee genera Haplomelitta and Samba, which comprise the former tribe Sambini (Hymenoptera : Melittidae), are revised here. The genera are endemic to the Afrotropical region, occurring in eastern and southern Africa. Previous studies hypothesised that Samba rendered Haplomelitta paraphyletic but a conclusive taxonomic decision was not proposed. By performing a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis based on five nuclear genes (28S, CAD, EF-1 alpha (F2 copy), long-wavelength rhodopsin (opsin) and RNA polymerase II (RNAp); total 4179 bp) and morphological characters (34 characters), we here synonymise Haplomelitta with Samba. The genus is now subdivided into six subgenera containing 10 species, four of which are here described as new, namely: S. ascheri, S. gessorum, S. spinosa and S. rubigoinis. Moreover, we also considered biogeography, phenology and floral visitation data. Samba seems to have originated in southern Africa and later colonised eastern Africa. The ancestral host-plant foraging strategy was probably specialisation on one plant family (e. g. oligolectism). This result supports the hypothesis that the ancestor of bees arose in Africa and was a host-plant specialist.},

A total of 9456 wild bees were collected and dissected to detect nematodes and 173 female and 22 male bees were positive for an overall association level of 2.1\%. Halictus resurgens was the most commonly collected bee found with nematodes with 82 and 19 nematode-infested female and male bees, respectively. Sixty-four of the nematode isolates were recovered from the Black Sea region (32.8\%), 59 from Central Anatolia (30.3\%), 35 from the Mediterranean (17.9\%), 24 from the Aegean (12.3\%), six from Eastern Anatolia (3.1\%) and seven from Southeast Anatolia (3.6\%). In 3.9\% of all bees of the family Halictidae (173/4417), nematodes were observed in the Dufour's gland, poison sac, oviduct, bursa copulatrix and abdominal cavity of dissected female bees and from the genital capsule of male bees. Only abdominal glands of 0.6\% (21/3279) of female bees from the family Andrenidae were observed with nematodes. Nematodes were isolated from the genital capsule of one male bee from the family Melittidae. The poison sac was the organ where nematodes were most often observed but the highest number of nematodes occurred in the abdominal cavity. Most nematodes were in the dauer juvenile stage making identification difficult. Sequence analysis using LSU D2/D3 domains and a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) allowed for putative identification of nematode isolates. Two or three species of Bursaphelenchus (B. anatolius, B. debrae, and potentially one or more cryptic species closest in morphology to B. anatolius) were isolated from six different halictid species (two genera; Halictus and Lasioglossum) from different geographical regions in Turkey. An additional four species of diplogastrid were recovered from the abdominal glands of andrenids; a new species of Koerneria from Andrena limata and a separate sister clade to Mononchoides composed of three other possible species from four Andrena species. An additional unknown species in the order Tylenchida (near Allantonematinae) was recovered from three species of Lasioglossum. No molecular data were obtained from three mermithid juveniles from two Andrena and one Halictus species because samples were lost in transit. The associations of most nematode isolates with bees of the families Halictidae and Andrenidae were hypothesised to be phoretic, whereas the tylenchid and mermithids were parasites.},

	abstract = {Bees, the largest ({\textgreater} 16,000 species) and most important radiation of pollinating insects, originated in early to mid-Cretaceous, roughly in synchrony with the angiosperms (flowering plants). Understanding the diversification of the bees and the coevolutionary history of bees and angiosperms requires a well supported phylogeny of bees (as well as angiosperms). We reconstructed a robust phylogeny of bees at the family and subfamily levels using a data set of five genes (4,299 nucleotide sites) plus morphology (109 characters). The molecular data set included protein coding (elongation factor-1 alpha, RNA polymerase II, and LW rhodopsin), as well as ribosomal (28S and 18S) nuclear gene data. Analyses of both the DNA data set and the DNA+morphology data set by parsimony and Bayesian methods yielded a single well supported family-level tree topology that places Melittidae as a paraphyletic group at the base of the phylogeny of bees. This topology (”Melittidae-LT basal”) is significantly better than a previously proposed alternative topology (”Colletidae basal”) based both on likelihood and Bayesian methods. Our results have important implications for understanding the early diversification, historical biogeography, host-plant evolution, and fossil record of bees. The earliest branches of bee phylogeny include lineages that are predominantly host-plant specialists, suggesting that host-plant specificity is an ancestral trait in bees. Our results suggest an African origin for bees, because the earliest branches of the tree include predominantly African lineages. These results also help explain the predominance of Melittidae, Apidae, and Megachilidae among the earliest fossil bees.},

	doi = {10.2307/2963476},
	abstract = {To determine the extent of host-plant specialization, the pollen sources of the 72 anthidiine species (family Megachilidae, subfamily Megachilinae, tribe Anthidiini) of Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor were investigated by microscopic analysis of approximate to 1800 pollen loads of females. By this measure, 31 species (43\%) were oligolectic (relatively specialized to pollen source) at the level of plant tribe, plant subfamily, or plant family. Exclusive pollen sources of these bees throughout their geographic ranges are flowers of the Cardueae (Compositae), the Asteroideae (Compositae), the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Lamioideae (Labiatae), the Nepetoideae (Labiatae), the Dipsacaceae, or the Campanulaceae. Thirteen species (18\%) were found to exhibit a strong, but not exclusive, preference for the Papilionoideae (Leguminosae), the Labiatae, the Cardueae (Compositae), and Zygophyllum (Zygophyllaceae), respectively, while 25 species (35\%) proved to be more markedly polylectic, visiting the flowers of up to 17 different plant families for pollen. The plants exploited by three species (4\%) are insufficiently known. By far the most important pollen sources of the anthidiine bees as a whole are the Compositae (41.7\%) followed by the Leguminosae (23.1\%) and the Labiatae (13.0\%). The phylogenetic relationships of the anthidiine bees were estimated by a cladistic analysis based on 115 characters to trace possible evolutionary patterns of diet composition. Based on the estimated phylogeny, at least eight shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa and six transitions between oligolecty and polylecty appear to have occurred. Four transitions were from oligolecty to polylecty whereas two transitions are of unknown direction, both directions being equally parsimonious. Assuming that the ancestral state in the anthidiine bees was oligolectic, the present distribution of oligolectic and polylectic species can be explained solely by switches from the oligolectic to the polylectic habit and by shifts of oligoleges between different plant taxa. Three of four transitions from oligolecty to polylecty are accompanied by a reduction in bee body size. The significance of this size reduction with respect to the polylectic habit is discussed. The oligolectic anthidiine species visit significantly fewer flower species for pollen during a single foraging bout than the polylectic species. On average, 1.4 plant species were recorded in the loads of specialists compared to 2.2 for generalists. Two monophyletic groups of bees belonging to the genus Anthidium are equipped with a pollen-collecting apparatus consisting of specialized hairs localized either on the face or on the underside of the thorax. It is used to remove pollen from the raised anthers of flowers of the Labiatae and the Scrophulariaceae and to brush pollen from the flat inflorescences of some Compositae, respectively. The observation of flower-visiting females of several anthidiine species revealed that pollen uptake is far from an accidental process. Basic pollen-harvesting techniques have reached a high degree of efficiency: females of a given bee species worked flowers of a certain plant species in a fixed manner, the structures used for pollen uptake from the same flower type were found to be largely the same among anthidiine bees of different taxonomic groups, and no distinct differences with respect to the basic pattern of pollen removal from flowers of the same architecture were obvious when comparing oligolectic and polylectic species. On the other hand, polyleges showed a high intraspecific flexibility regarding the organs used for pollen uptake from flowers of a different architecture.},

Yellowjackets and hornets constitute one of the only two lineages of highly eusocial wasps, and the distribution of key behavioral traits correlates closely with the current classification of the group. The potential of the Vespinae to elucidate the evolution of social life, however, remains limited due to ambiguous genus-level relationships. Here, we address the relationships among genera within the Vespinae using transcriptomic (RNA-seq) data. We sequenced the transcriptomes of six vespid wasps, including three of the four genera recognized in the Vespinae, combined our data with publicly available transcriptomes, and assembled two matrices comprising 1,507 and 3,356 putative single-copy genes. The results of our phylogenomic analyses recover Dolichovespula as more closely related to Vespa than to Vespula, therefore challenging the prevailing hypothesis of yellowjacket (Vespula + Dolichovespula) monophyly. This suggests that traits such as large colony size and high paternity arose in the genus Vespula following its early divergence from the remaining vespine genera. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

There were 20,9991 SSRs distributed throughout the genome of A. cerana (Korea strain) and di-nucleotides were the most frequent SSR type. Both total number and density of SSRs in A. cerana genome were smaller than that in A. mellifera genome. Through comparing length discrepancy of SSRs loci among several isolates based on sequence alignment, 218 potential polymorphic SSRs primers derived from A. cerana were presented. Five among these SSR markers were evaluated for amplification in twenty-eight colonies of Apis cerana cerana (Chinese honeybee), which showed highly polymorphic, with the value of Polymorphism information content (PIC) ranging from 0.47 to 0.61. All these results will contribute to further develop more effective SSRs markers derived from A. cerana, which can be used to study genetic structure and population polymorphism of Asian honeybee.

	abstract = {Encarsia pergandiellaHoward, described from North America (USA), and Encarsia tabacivoraViggiani, described from South America (Brazil) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), are two formally recognized taxonomic entities, that have been treated by several authors as synonyms due to lack of strong diagnostic characters. Taxonomy of these species is further complicated because several populations, geographically separated and differing in their biology, have been included under the concept of E. pergandiella. Among these, a population originally collected in Brazil and introduced to North America reproduces by thelytokous parthenogenesis and is infected by the symbiont Cardinium, while a morphologically indistinguishable population, naturally occurring in Texas, is biparental and infected by a related strain of Cardinium that induces cytoplasmic incompatibility. A third population known from California and introduced to the Old World is biparental and uninfected by intracellular symbionts. While adult females of the first two populations have entirely light yellow bodies and pupate face up (light form), those of the third population have largely brown bodies and pupate face down (dark form). Other dark form populations are known from Texas, Florida and New York. Because these parasitoids are economically important biological control agents of cosmopolitan whitefly pests, it is critical to characterize them correctly. In this study, we integrated molecular and morphometric analyses to substantiate observed differences in biological traits, and resolve the complicated taxonomy of this species complex. We sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and the D2 region of the ribosomal 28S gene for individuals of both light form (from Texas and Brazil) and dark form (from California, Texas, Italy and Canary Islands) originating from laboratory cultures or collected in the field. Phylogenetic analysis unambiguously distinguished three well-supported groups corresponding to the Texas light form, the Brazil light form and the dark form. Individuals of these three groups, in combination with all available type material (E. pergandiella, its synonym Encarsia versicolorGirault and E. tabacivora) and additional museum specimens of the dark form from New York and Italy, were subjected to multivariate morphometric analyses using Burnaby principal component analysis followed by a linear discriminant analysis, and multivariate ratio analysis. Overall, the analyses showed that: (i) E. pergandiella and E. tabacivora are two distinct species; (ii) the thelytokous Brazil light form corresponds to E. tabacivora; (iii) the biparental Texas light form is a new species formally described here as Encarsia suzannaesp.n.; (iv) two new biparental species can be referred to the dark form, one described as Encarsia gennaroisp.n. including the populations sampled in California, Texas, Italy and Canary Islands, and the other corresponding to the population from New York described as Encarsia marthaesp.n. A dichotomous key for both sexes of the species of the E. pergandiella complex is provided for identification. This published work has been registered in ZooBank, .},

Velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) provide a unique system to study mate finding because short-lived flying males must find solitary, wingless females that have spatially and temporally dispersed emergence. Based on limited field observations, it is thought that male velvet ants may use visual, chemical, and vibratory cues for mate finding, though there have been no controlled experiments to test these hypotheses. Using choice experiments, this study aims to determine the role of visual and airborne chemical cues used in female detection by three sympatric species of Dasymutilla males. We find that visual cues are not used for initial female detection and that airborne chemicals are sufficient for female detection. We also discover that males readily approach females of different species, indicating airborne chemicals are not used for species recognition. Despite the lack of discrimination by males, we determined that the sympatric, morphologically similar species show no genetic introgression, and therefore some other isolating mechanism must be at play after males make initial contact with the females.},

We examine intra-specific relationships within A. obliqua as well as inter specific relationships to other Anastrepha species using a multi-locus data set comprising nine loci (seven nuclear, two mitochondrial) with 105 operational taxonomic units. The results based on a concatenated set of nuclear loci strongly support the monophyly of A. obliqua and most of the other species previously identified by morphology. A split between Peruvian A. obliqua samples and those from other locations was also identified. These results contrast with prior findings of relationships within A. obliqua based on mitochondrial data, as we found a marked discrepancy between nuclear and mitochondrial loci. These analyses suggest that introgression, particularly between A. obliqua and fraterculus species, may be one explanation for the discrepancy and the high mitochondrial diversity reported for A. obliqua could be the result of incomplete lineage sorting.

In the present work, we performed RNAseq of Microplitis mediator antennae and identified seventeen IRs. Full-length MmedIRs were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the Hymenoptera IRs revealed that ten MmedIR genes encoded “antennal IRs” and seven encoded “divergent IRs”. Among the IR25a orthologous groups, two genes, MmedIR25a.1 and MmedIR25a.2, were found in M. mediator. Gene structure analysis of MmedIR25a revealed a tandem duplication of IR25a in M. mediator. The tissue distribution and development specific expression of the MmedIR genes suggested that these genes showed a broad expression profile. Quantitative gene expression analysis showed that most of the genes are highly enriched in adult antennae, indicating the candidate chemosensory function of this family in parasitic wasps. Using immunocytochemistry, we confirmed that one co-receptor, MmedlR8a, was expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons. Our data will supply fundamental information for functional analysis of the IRs in parasitoid wasp chemoreception. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We used molecular markers to reconstruct the demographic range expansion and colonization routes of P. pruinosa from its native range into temperate NA. Populations east of the Rocky Mountains expanded from the wild host plant's range in Mexico and were established by a series of founder events. Eastern North America was most likely colonized from squash bee populations in the present-day continental Midwest USA and not from routes that followed the Gulf and Atlantic coasts from Mexico. Populations of P. pruinosa west of the Rockies spread north from the warm deserts much more recently, showing two genetically differentiated populations with no admixture: one in California and the other one in eastern Great Basin. These bees have repeatedly endured severe bottlenecks as they colonized NA, following human spread of their Cucurbita pollen hosts during the Holocene.},

	abstract = {Transformer (tra) is the key gene that turns on the sex-determination cascade in Drosophila melanogaster and in some other insects. The honeybee Apis mellifera has two duplicates of tra, one of which (complementary sex determiner, csd) is the primary signal for complementary sex-determination (CSD), regulating the other duplicate (feminizer). Two tra duplicates have been found in some other hymenopteran species, resulting in the assumption that a single ancestral duplication of tra took place in the Hymenoptera. Here, we searched for tra homologues and pseudogenes in the Hymenoptera, focusing on five newly published hymenopteran genomes. We found three tra copies in the fig wasp Ceratosolen solmsi. Further evolutionary and expression analyses also showed that the two duplicates (Csoltra-B and Csoltra-C) are under positive selection, and have female-specific expression, suggesting possible sex-related functions. Moreover, Aculeata species exhibit many pseudogenes generated by lineage-specific duplications. We conclude that phylogenetic reconstruction and pseudogene screening provide novel evidence supporting the hypothesis of independent duplications rather an ancestral origin of multiple tra paralogues in the Hymenoptera. The case of C. solmsi is the first example of a non-CSD species with duplicated tra, contrary to the previous assumption that derived tra paralogues function as the CSD locus.},

	abstract = {The integration of independent data sets could solve problems in both traditional and DNA-based taxonomy. The aim of this study is to investigate the power of CO1 sequences and of morphometrics to distinguish closely related species in the spider genus Araniella. We put special emphasis on the species pair A. cucurbitina (Clerck, 1757) and A. opisthographa (Kulczynski, 1905) since the females are morphologically difficult to distinguish and often misidentified. A total of 216 sequences of eight Araniella species from seven European countries, North America and Asia were included in the molecular analysis. The results from both maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference indicate successful separation of six out of eight Araniella species, including A. cucurbitina and A. opisthographa. For the same six species, we detect no overlap of intra- and interspecific genetic divergence, leading to successful species identification with a threshold approach. In addition, morphometric analysis of the epigyna of A. cucurbitina and A. opisthographa supports species separation by two best explanatory ratios: receptaculum length and distance between receptaculum and copulatory duct. Although a small overlap in the ratios exists, the species identification rate increases when combining morphometric and molecular data, which demonstrates the efficiency of integrative approaches for distinguishing closely related species. However, none of the molecular approaches was able to separate closely related A. alpica (L. Koch, 1869) and A. inconspicua (Simon, 1874) due to shared CO1 haplotypes. Considering the clear morphological separation of the males and different habitat preferences, incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization could have led to identical CO1 sequences. Therefore, DNA-barcoding must be thoroughly tested even within small homogenous genera of spiders.},

Recently, new gateways for understanding social evolution have opened up due to advances in genomics, allowing for unprecedented opportunities in studying social behavior on a molecular level. In particular, highly eusocial insect species (caste-containing societies with nonreproductives that care for siblings) have taken center stage in studies of the molecular evolution of sociality. Despite advances in genomic studies of both solitary and eusocial insects, we still lack genomic resources for early insect societies. To study the genetic basis of social traits requires comparison of genomes from a diversity of organisms ranging from solitary to complex social forms. Here we present the genome of a subsocial bee, Ceratina calcarata. This study begins to address the types of genomic changes associated with the earliest origins of simple sociality using the small carpenter bee. Genes associated with lipid transport and DNA recombination have undergone positive selection in C. calcarata relative to other bee lineages. Furthermore, we provide the first methylome of a noneusocial bee. Ceratina calcarata contains the complete enzymatic toolkit for DNA methylation. As in the honey bee and many other holometabolous insects, DNA methylation is targeted to exons. The addition of this genome allows for new lines of research into the genetic and epigenetic precursors to complex social behaviors.},

Overall, most of the analysed generalist morphospecies were shown to be composed of subgroups related to the aphid host, some of them revealed as cryptic species by the species delimitation analysis.

	abstract = {As increasingly large molecular data sets are collected for phylogenomics, the conflicting phylogenetic signal among gene trees poses challenges to resolve some difficult nodes of the Tree of Life. Among these nodes, the phylogenetic position of the honey bees (Apini) within the corbiculate bee group remains controversial, despite its considerable importance for understanding the emergence and maintenance of eusociality. Here, we show that this controversy stems in part from pervasive phylogenetic conflicts among GC-rich gene trees. GC-rich genes typically have a high nucleotidic heterogeneity among species, which can induce topological conflicts among gene trees. When retaining only themost GC-homogeneous genes or using a nonhomogeneous model of sequence evolution, our analyses reveal a monophyletic group of the three lineages with a eusocial lifestyle (honey bees, bumble bees, and stingless bees). These phylogenetic relationships strongly suggest a single origin of eusociality in the corbiculate bees, with no reversal to solitary living in this group. To accurately reconstruct other important evolutionary steps across the Tree of Life, we suggest removing GC-rich and GC-heterogeneous genes from large phylogenomic data sets. Interpreted as a consequence of genome-wide variations in recombination rates, this GC effect can affect all taxa featuring GC-biased gene conversion, which is common in eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {Bayesian total-evidence dating involves the simultaneous analysis of morphological data from the fossil record and morphological and sequence data from recent organisms, and it accommodates the uncertainty in the placement of fossils while dating the phylogenetic tree. Due to the flexibility of the Bayesian approach, total-evidence dating can also incorporate additional sources of information. Here, we take advantage of this and expand the analysis to include information about fossilization and sampling processes. Our work is based on the recently described fossilized birth-death (FBD) process, which has been used to model speciation, extinction, and fossilization rates that can vary over time in a piecewise manner. So far, sampling of extant and fossil taxa has been assumed to be either complete or uniformly at random, an assumption which is only valid for a minority of data sets. We therefore extend the FBD process to accommodate diversified sampling of extant taxa, which is standard practice in studies of higher-level taxa. We verify the implementation using simulations and apply it to the early radiation of Hymenoptera (wasps, ants, and bees). Previous total-evidence dating analyses of this data set were based on a simple uniform tree prior and dated the initial radiation of extant Hymenoptera to the late Carboniferous (309 Ma). The analyses using the FBD prior under diversified sampling, however, date the radiation to the Triassic and Permian (252 Ma), slightly older than the age of the oldest hymenopteran fossils. By exploring a variety of FBD model assumptions, we show that it is mainly the accommodation of diversified sampling that causes the push toward more recent divergence times. Accounting for diversified sampling thus has the potential to close the long-discussed gap between rocks and clocks. We conclude that the explicit modeling of fossilization and sampling processes can improve divergence time estimates, but only if all important model aspects, including sampling biases, are adequately addressed.},

The mycophagous adult nematodes were characterised by the relative position of the excretory pore, located at 25 (19-28) and 25 (18-30) mu m anterior to the hemizonid in the male and female, respectively, and a broad female tail with a rounded distal end. Typologically, the new species forms a cryptic species complex with D. siricidicola and D. canii. In addition, the new species and D. siricidicola share the same host wasp, tree and fungal species in Japan. However, the cryptic species can be separated from each other based on the described morphological and molecular sequence differences in the mtCOI gene.},

The analyses consisted of a careful review of the distribution of different wasps of the subfamily Polistinae with available phylogenies and the association of this information with colonization routes. This procedure allowed the determination of a two-step colonization process in the Neotropical region based on the progression rule principle, for which the round-trip hypothesis is proposed. The first route (east to west) is seen in a small group of Polistes. This route is rare but strengthens the arising of paper wasps in the Americas in a Gondwanan scenario. The second route (west to east) is remarkably repeated in several other lineages. Thus, the northwestern Neotropics, mainly Amazon Forest, is proposed as the major center of origins for living Neotropical Polistinae and the round-trip hypothesis may explain both earlier and later colonization routes of the paper wasps analyzed.},

	abstract = {Background: In social Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), various chemical compounds present on the cuticle have been shown to act as fertility signals. In addition, specific queen-characteristic hydrocarbons have been implicated as sterility-inducing queen signals in ants, wasps and bumblebees. In Corbiculate bees, however, the chemical nature of queen-characteristic and fertility-linked compounds appears to be more diverse than in ants and wasps. Moreover, it remains unknown how queen signals evolved across this group and how they might have been co-opted from fertility signals in solitary ancestors. Results: Here, we perform a phylogenetic analysis of fertility-linked compounds across 16 species of solitary and eusocial bee species, comprising both literature data as well as new primary data from a key solitary outgroup species, the oil-collecting bee Centris analis, and the highly eusocial stingless bee Scaptotrigona depilis. Our results demonstrate the presence of fertility-linked compounds belonging to 12 different chemical classes. In addition, we find that some classes of compounds (linear and branched alkanes, alkenes, esters and fatty acids) were already present as fertility-linked signals in the solitary ancestors of Corbiculate bees, while others appear to be specific to certain species. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that queen signals in Corbiculate bees are likely derived from ancestral fertility-linked compounds present in solitary bees that lacked reproductive castes. These original fertility-linked cues or signals could have been produced either as a by-product of ovarian activation or could have served other communicative purposes, such as in mate recognition or the regulation of egg-laying.},

D. zhuili overlaps with OCGW in emergence time and induces galls morphologically similar to that of OCGW on similar plant parts.

Herein, we confirm the identity of the new species based on morphological and biological differences and provide a formal description. Although the new species is relatively easily separated from OCGW on basis of morphology, field identification involving the two species can still be problematic because of their small body size, highly similar gall morphology, and other life history traits.

Contrary to initial expectations that selfish elements such as Ty1-copia would be purged from the genomes of these species because of inbreeding and haplodiploidy, almost all of these wasps harbour an abundance of diverse Ty1-copia elements. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the families of Ty1-copia elements found in these species have had a long association with their chalcid hosts. These results suggest an evolutionary scenario in which there was ancestral polymorphism followed by some taxa-specific events including stochastic loss and further diversification. Furthermore, estimating natural selection within the internal and terminal portions of the Ty1-copia phylogenies demonstrated that the elements are under strong evolutionary constraints for their long-term survival, but evolve like pseudogenes in the short term, accompanied by the rise and fall of parasitic elements in the history of wasp lineage.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12862-015-0423-0},
	abstract = {Background: The use of transcriptomic and genomic datasets for phylogenetic reconstruction has become increasingly common as researchers attempt to resolve recalcitrant nodes with increasing amounts of data. The large size and complexity of these datasets introduce significant phylogenetic noise and conflict into subsequent analyses. The sources of conflict may include hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting, or horizontal gene transfer, and may vary across the phylogeny. For phylogenetic analysis, this noise and conflict has been accommodated in one of several ways: by binning gene regions into subsets to isolate consistent phylogenetic signal; by using gene-tree methods for reconstruction, where conflict is presumed to be explained by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS); or through concatenation, where noise is presumed to be the dominant source of conflict. The results provided herein emphasize that analysis of individual homologous gene regions can greatly improve our understanding of the underlying conflict within these datasets. Results: Here we examined two published transcriptomic datasets, the angiosperm group Caryophyllales and the aculeate Hymenoptera, for the presence of conflict, concordance, and gene duplications in individual homologs across the phylogeny. We found significant conflict throughout the phylogeny in both datasets and in particular along the backbone. While some nodes in each phylogeny showed patterns of conflict similar to what might be expected with ILS alone, the backbone nodes also exhibited low levels of phylogenetic signal. In addition, certain nodes, especially in the Caryophyllales, had highly elevated levels of strongly supported conflict that cannot be explained by ILS alone. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that phylogenetic signal is highly variable in phylogenomic data sampled across related species and poses challenges when conducting species tree analyses on large genomic and transcriptomic datasets. Further insight into the conflict and processes underlying these complex datasets is necessary to improve and develop adequate models for sequence analysis and downstream applications. To aid this effort, we developed the open source software phyparts (https://bitbucket.org/blackrim/phyparts), which calculates unique, conflicting, and concordant bipartitions, maps gene duplications, and outputs summary statistics such as internode certainy (ICA) scores and node-specific counts of gene duplications.},

In this study, we investigated whether diversification of Tenthredinoidea could be attributed to their use of angiosperms as hosts by examining host plant usage by lineage. We performed molecular phylogenetic and divergence time estimation analyses using molecular data (similar to 2 kilobase sequence in five DNA regions) and conducted a diversification analysis. Our results suggest that Tenthredinoidea (excluding Blasticotomidae) had used angiosperms since its origin; the phylogeny of Tenthredinoidea showed a significant shift in diversification at two nodes, and those nodes overlap with the periods of origin and diversification of angiosperms.},

	abstract = {The braconid subfamily Euphorinae is a large, cosmopolitan group of endoparasitoid wasps. The majority of species attack adult hosts, a strategy that is rare among parasitic wasps, but there are also many species that attack nymphs and larval stages. Euphorine hosts may belong to a variety of insect orders (Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Neuroptera, Psocoptera, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera) although most euphorine tribes are confined to Coleoptera. Here we investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the Euphorinae based on molecular data (3 kb of nucleotide data from four markers: 18S, 28S, CAD and COI) and propose a higher-level classification based upon the resulting phylogeny. We also infer the evolution of host associations and discuss the diversification of the Euphorinae. Results from both Bayesian inference and maximum-likelihood analysis show that the subfamily, as previously circumscribed, is paraphyletic. We propose that the subfamily be expanded to include the tribes Meteorini and Planitorini (Mannokeraia + Planitorus), so that it corresponds to a clade that is strongly supported as monophyletic in our analyses. Based on our results, a revised higher classification of the Euphorinae is proposed, in which 52 extant genera and 14 tribes are recognized. We reinstate the genus Microctonus belonging to the tribe Perilitini, and synonymize Ussuraridelus with Holdawayella, Sinuatophorus with Eucosmophorus. Furthermore, we propose the following tribal rearrangements: Spathicopis and Stenothremma are transferred to Perilitini; Tuberidelus, Eucosmophorus and Plynops to Cosmophorini; Ecclitura to Dinocampini; Chrysopophthorus, Holdawayella and Wesmaelia to Helorimorphini; Proclithroporus and Heia to Townesilitini. The monotypic tribe Cryptoxilonini is synonymized with Cosmophorini. The genera Pygostolus and Litostolus are placed in a separate tribe, Pygostolini, previously recognized as a subtribe among the Centistini. Parsimony-based ancestral state reconstructions suggest that the ancestor of Euphorinae was a parasitoid of lepidopteran larvae, and that a host shift to larval Coleoptera occurred only in one clade of the Meteorini, some members of which secondarily shifted back to larval lepidopteran hosts. In the remainder of the subfamily, there was an initial shift from larval to adult coleopterans, followed by subsequent shifts to adults or larvae of Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Neuroptera, Orthoptera and Psocoptera.},

The identification of the parasitic strategy of the genus Stylops (Strepsiptera; Stylopidae) is, however, ambiguous. According to the number of recognized species based on existing taxonomy, highly specialized and supergeneralistic species exist in this genus. Our research aims to clarify the concept of host specialization in the genus Stylops, in which all of the members are parasites of Andrena bees. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the parasites (mostly females) and the mapping of hosts onto the phylogenetic tree, we tested three hypotheses of host specialization: (1) each species of the genus Stylops is associated with a single host species; (2) Stylops species are specialized to a group of closely related hosts; and (3) a single Stylops species is a generalist, parasitizing all host Andrena species in this particular region. Our evidence clearly shows a close relationship between the parasite and the host: one species of Stylops attacks one or a few host species of Andrena bees, usually from a single subgenus. Moreover, a moderate generalistic strategy is also likely in a few Stylops species. According to our results, the species diversity of the strepsipteran parasites of bees must be reconsidered. A single European species of Stylops should be divided into a higher number of valid species.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London},

	abstract = {Gaining a genomic perspective on phylogeny requires the collection of data from many putatively independent loci across the genome. Among insects, an increasingly common approach to collecting this class of data involves transcriptome sequencing, because few insects have high-quality genome sequences available; assembling new genomes remains a limiting factor; the transcribed portion of the genome is a reasonable, reduced subset of the genome to target; and the data collected from transcribed portions of the genome are similar in composition to the types of data with which biologists have traditionally worked (e.g. exons). However, molecular techniques requiring RNA as a template, including transcriptome sequencing, are limited to using very high-quality source materials, which are often unavailable from a large proportion of biologically important insect samples. Recent research suggests that DNA-based target enrichment of conserved genomic elements offers another path to collecting phylogenomic data across insect taxa, provided that conserved elements are present in and can be collected from insect genomes. Here, we identify a large set (n=1510) of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) shared among the insect order Hymenoptera. We used in silico analyses to show that these loci accurately reconstruct relationships among genome-enabled hymenoptera, and we designed a set of RNA baits (n=2749) for enriching these loci that researchers can use with DNA templates extracted from a variety of sources. We used our UCE bait set to enrich an average of 721 UCE loci from 30 hymenopteran taxa, and we used these UCE loci to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships spanning very old (220Ma) to very young (1Ma) divergences among hymenopteran lineages. In contrast to a recent study addressing hymenopteran phylogeny using transcriptome data, we found ants to be sister to all remaining aculeate lineages with complete support, although this result could be explained by factors such as taxon sampling. We discuss this approach and our results in the context of elucidating the evolutionary history of one of the most diverse and speciose animal orders.},

	abstract = {Delimitation of closely related species is often hindered by the lack of discrete diagnostic morphological characters. This is exemplified in bumblebees (genus Bombus). There have been many attempts to clarify bumblebee taxonomy by using alternative features to discrete morphological characters such as wing shape, DNA, or eco-chemical traits. Nevertheless each approach has its own limitations. Recent studies have used a multisource approach to gather different lines of speciation evidence in order to draw a strongly supported taxonomic hypothesis in bumblebees. Yet, the resulting taxonomic status is not independent of selected evidence and of consensus methodology (i.e. unanimous procedure, majority, different weighting of evidence). In this article, we compare taxonomic conclusions for a group of taxonomically doubtful species (the Bombus lapidarius-group) obtained from the four commonly used lines of evidence for species delimitation in bumblebees (geometric morphometric of wing shape, genetic differentiation assessment, sequence-based species delimitation methods and differentiation of cephalic labial gland secretions). We ultimately aim to assess the usefulness of these lines of evidence as components of an integrative decision framework to delimit bumblebee species. Our results show that analyses based on wing shape do not delineate any obvious cluster. In contrast, nuclear/mitochondrial, sequence-based species delimitation methods, and analyses based on cephalic labial gland secretions are congruent with each other. This allows setting up an integrative decision framework to establish strongly supported species and subspecies status within bumblebees.},

Eragenia Banks is revalidated (stat. rev.) and applied to 16 species, eight of which are newly described: Eragenia bellaWaichert \& Pitts sp.n., E. carinataWaichert \& Pitts sp.n., E. dentataWaichert \& Pitts sp.n., E. olivaWaichert \& Pitts sp.n., E. pseudomicansWaichert \& Pitts sp.n., E. setosaWaichert \& Pitts sp.n., E. rotundaWaichert \& Pitts sp.n., E. villosaWaichert \& Pitts sp.n., E. abdominalis (Smith), E. amabilis (Taschenberg), E. aureicornis (Smith), E. coerulipes (Smith), E. congrua (Fox), E. isolata (Banks), E. micans (Fabricius), and E. tabascoensis (Cameron). Priocnemella fairchildi (Banks), P. insignis (Banks), P. eurythemeBanks, P. hexagona (Fox) and P. hexagona omissaBanks maintain their generic status. Phanochilus Banks is considered a junior synonym of Priocnemella and the following species are newly placed within Priocnemella: P. fuscomarginata (Fox), P. gloriosa (Smith), P. nobilitata (Smith) and P. ornata (Banks). The following nomenclatural changes are proposed: Priocnemella rufothorax (Banks) is synonymized under Eragenia micans (Fabricius) (syn. n.); Priocnemella delila (Banks), Priocnemella bequaerti (Banks) and Priocnemella infelix (Banks) are junior synonyms of Eragenia aureicornis (Smith) (syn.n.) (comb.n). New combinations are proposed for Eragenia aureicornis (Smith) comb.n., Eragenia abdominalis (Smith) comb.n. and Eragenia coerulipes (Smith) comb.n. from Agenia; and Eragenia congrua (Fox) comb.n. from Salius. A neotype is designated for E. coerulipes and for E. tabascoensis. Divergence dates between species of Eragenia, ancestral areas and pattern of dispersal that shaped the current geographic distribution are discussed. The genus is about 9.8Ma old, originating in Mesoamerica during the Miocene. Finally, newly described male genitalic characters are discussed and illustrated, and illustrated keys for males and females species of Eragenia are provided.

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of barcodes for Megabombus species shows that B. koreanus is one of the more recently diverged species and the sister species to Bombus consobrinus. Our results show that specimens with previously unknown colour patterns also belong to B. koreanus. We describe nine different colour patterns for workers and three for queens, in which the hair of the thorax varies from black to orange-brown. However, there is a lack of covariation between COI and colour-pattern variation. B. koreanus has been recorded to visit 11 species of food plants showing that B. koreanus is polylectic.

	abstract = {Likelihood-based methods are commonplace in phylogenetic systematics. Although much effort has been directed toward likelihood-based models for molecular data, comparatively less work has addressed models for discrete morphological character (DMC) data. Among-character rate variation (ACRV) may confound phylogenetic analysis, but there have been few analyses of the magnitude and distribution of rate heterogeneity among DMCs. Using 76 data sets covering a range of plants, invertebrate, and vertebrate animals, we used a modified version of MrBayes to test equal, gamma-distributed and lognormally distributed models of ACRV, integrating across phylogenetic uncertainty using Bayesian model selection. We found that in approximately 80\% of data sets, unequal-rates models outperformed equal-rates models, especially among larger data sets. Moreover, although most data sets were equivocal, more data sets favored the lognormal rate distribution relative to the gamma rate distribution, lending some support for more complex character correlations than in molecular data. Parsimony estimation of the underlying rate distributions in several data sets suggests that the lognormal distribution is preferred when there are many slowly evolving characters and fewer quickly evolving characters. The commonly adopted four rate category discrete approximation used for molecular data was found to be sufficient to approximate a gamma rate distribution with discrete characters. However, among the two data sets tested that favored a lognormal rate distribution, the continuous distribution was better approximated with at least eight discrete rate categories. Although the effect of rate model on the estimation of topology was difficult to assess across all data sets, it appeared relatively minor between the unequal-rates models for the one data set examined carefully. As in molecular analyses, we argue that researchers should test and adopt the most appropriate model of rate variation for the data set in question. As discrete characters are increasingly used in more sophisticated likelihood-based phylogenetic analyses, it is important that these studies be built on the most appropriate and carefully selected underlying models of evolution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUNDBemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is the vector of cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs) and cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs) in Africa, which cause devastating yield losses. As a prerequisite to developing biological control methods and enhancing knowledge of the fauna of whitefly parasitoids in sub-Saharan Africa, endemic parasitoids were surveyed in the cassava-growing regions of Tanzania and analysed using both morphological and molecular methods. An attempt was made to corroborate the identification of the parasitoid species on the basis of consideration of their morphology and sequence analyses of three DNA fragments, namely partial cytochrome oxidase I (COI), the D2 expansion segment of the 28S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer I (ITS1). RESULTSEight whitefly species colonising cassava and twelve species of parasitoids were detected. A species in the Encarsia strenua group and a species in the Eretmocerus mundus group were the most common parasitoids. Molecular systematics indicated the occurrence of two new species of Eretmocerus Haldeman parasitising B. tabaci. CONCLUSIONThe accurate identification of natural enemies is an essential first step in developing effective biological control solutions for B. tabaci in Tanzania and the wider cassava-growing environments of Africa. The new data provided here represent an important contribution to this goal. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry},

	doi = {10.1186/s12862-015-0304-6},
	abstract = {Background: Thelytoky, the parthenogenetic development of females, has independently evolved in several insect orders yet the study of its mechanisms has so far mostly focussed on haplodiploid Hymenoptera, while alternative mechanisms of thelytoky such as polyploidy are far less understood. In haplodiploid insects, thelytoky can be encoded in their genomes, or induced by maternally inherited bacteria such as Wolbachia or Cardinium. Microbially facilitated thelytoky usually results in complete homozygosity due to gamete duplication and can be reverted into arrhenotoky, the parthenogenetic development of males, through treatment with antibiotics. In contrast, genetically encoded thelytoky cannot be removed and may result in conservation of heterozygosity due to gamete fusion. We have probed the obligate thelytoky of the greenhouse thrips, Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis (Bouche), a significant cosmopolitan pest and a model species of thelytoky in the haplodiploid insect order Thysanoptera. Earlier studies suggested terminal fusion as a mechanism for thelytoky in this species, while another study reported presence of Wolbachia; later it was speculated that Wolbachia plays a role in this thrips' thelytokous reproduction. Results: By using PCR and sequence analysis, we demonstrated that global population samples of H. haemorrhoidalis were not infected with Wolbachia, Cardinium or any other known bacterial reproductive manipulators. Antibiotic treatment of this thrips did also not result in male production. Some individuals carried two different alleles in two nuclear loci, histone 3 and elongation factor 1 alpha, suggesting heterozygosity. However, the majority of individuals had three different alleles suggesting that they were polyploid. Genetic diversity across both nuclear loci was low in all populations, and absent from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I, indicating that this species had experienced genetic bottlenecks, perhaps due to its invasion biology or a switch to thelytoky. Conclusions: Geographically broad sampling and experimental manipulation revealed low genetic diversity, absence of Wolbachia but presence of three different alleles of nuclear loci in most analysed individuals of obligately thelytokous H. haemorrhoidalis. This suggests that polyploidy may be involved in the thelytokous reproduction of this thrips species, and polyploidy may be a contributing factor in the reproduction of Thysanoptera and other haplodiploid insect orders.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12862-015-0293-5},
	abstract = {Background: Morphological divergence often increases with phylogenetic distance, thus making morphology taxonomically informative. However, transitions to asexual reproduction may complicate this relationship because asexual lineages capture and freeze parts of the phenotypic variation of the sexual populations from which they derive. Parasitoid wasps belonging to the genus Lysiphlebus Foerster (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) are composed of over 20 species that exploit over a hundred species of aphid hosts, including many important agricultural pests. Within Lysiphlebus, two genetically and morphologically well- defined species groups are recognised: the “fabarum” and the “testaceipes” groups. Yet within each group, sexual as well as asexual lineages occur, and in L. fabarum different morphs of unknown origin and status have been recognised. In this study, we selected a broad sample of specimens from the genus Lysiphlebus to explore the relationship between genetic divergence, reproductive mode and morphological variation in wing size and shape (quantified by geometric morphometrics). Results: The analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences revealed a clear separation between the “testaceipes” and “fabarum” groups of Lysiphlebus, as well as three well-defined phylogenetic lineages within the “fabarum” species group and two lineages within the “testaceipes” group. Divergence in wing shape was concordant with the deep split between the “testaceipes” and “fabarum” species groups, but within groups no clear association between genetic divergence and wing shape variation was observed. On the other hand, we found significant and consistent differences in the shape of the wing between sexual and asexual lineages, even when they were closely related. Conclusions: Mapping wing shape data onto an independently derived molecular phylogeny of Lysiphlebus revealed an association between genetic and morphological divergence only for the deepest phylogenetic split. In more recently diverged taxa, much of the variation in wing shape was explained by differences between sexual and asexual lineages, suggesting a mechanistic link between wing shape and reproductive mode in these parasitoid wasps.},

During the past decade, a number of hypotheses on the phylogenetic relationships among hymenopteran families and superfamilies have been presented, based on analyses of molecular and/or morphological data. Nevertheless, many questions still remain, particularly concerning relationships within the hyperdiverse suborder Apocrita, but also when it comes to the evolutionary history of the ancestrally herbivorous sawfly lineages that form the basal, paraphyletic grade Symphyta. Because a large part of the uncertainty appears to stem from limited molecular and taxonomic sampling, we set out to investigate the phylogeny of Hymenoptera using nine protein-coding genes, of which five are new to analyses of the order. In addition, we more than tripled the taxon coverage across the symphytan grade, introducing representatives for many previously unsampled lineages. We recover a well supported phylogenetic structure for these early herbivorous hymenopteran clades, with new information regarding the monophyly of Xyelidae, the placement of the superfamily Pamphilioidea as sister to Tenthredinoidea+Unicalcarida, as well as the interrelationships among the tenthredinoid families Tenthredinidae, Cimbicidae, and Diprionidae. Based on the obtained phylogenies, and to prevent paraphyly of Tenthredinidae, we propose erection of the tribe Heptamelini to family status (Heptamelidae). In particular, our results give new insights into subfamilial relationships within the Tenthredinidae and other species-rich sawfly families. The expanded gene set provides a useful toolbox for future detailed analyses of symphytan subgroups, especially within the diverse superfamily Tenthredinoidea. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2014.},

Detailed descriptions and illustrations of the male terminalia are presented along with a key for the identification of all nine European species of the group. Phylogenetic analyses of molecular data generally supported the morphological species discrimination. The barcoding region of COI superseded ITS2 rDNA in resolving species. In the COI barcoding region interspecific differences ranged from 2.9 to 10.6\% and the intraspecific distance from 0.08 to 0.8\%.

It is also one of the largest herbivorous groups within the order, some species having substantial economic impact. Until very recently, no comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the superfamily had been undertaken.

In total, 129 taxa were scored for 146 characters from the adult head, thorax, wings and ovipositor apparatus. The emphasis of the taxon sample is on Tenthredinidae (104 terminals), which is by far the largest family in the Tenthredinoidea. The results of the cladistic analyses confirm the monophyly of the Tenthredinoidea, the first split being between the Blasticotomidae and the remaining families (Tenthredinoidea s. str., also monophyletic), and the monophyly of all families except Tenthredinidae. The analyses fail to consistently retrieve any of the six currently recognised subfamilies within Tenthredinidae, although core clades of Heterarthrinae, Nematinae, Selandriinae and Tenthredininae are often supported. Diprionidae are placed inside the Nematinae under some weighting conditions. The failure to corroborate the tenthredinid subfamilies might be ascribed to an insufficient character/terminal ratio, but also to problems with the existing classification. Inclusion of characters from the male genitalia and the larval stages as well as molecular data currently being assembled will hopefully lead to a more robust classification of the Tenthredinidae in the future.},

The methods were used to classify colonies and workers from a mixed population of A. m. mellifera and A. m. carnica. There was highly significant correlation between results obtained using the three methods. More than three quarters of colonies were classified to the same subspecies by all three methods. The agreement was highest between microsatellites and morphometrics. More than 90 \% of colonies were classified to the same subspecies by the two methods. There was also relatively high agreement (75 \%) between microsatellites and morphometrics when workers were classified as pure subspecies or hybrids. In particular, one pure subspecies was never misclassified as other pure subspecies. The results presented here show that morphometrics can be used for detection of hybrids between A. m. mellifera and A. m. carnica.},

The shape and ultrastructure of spermatozoa of the two species are very similar to those of other Cicadellidae as well as other Auchenorrhyncha, comprising a conical acrosome invaginated to form a subacrosomal space, a filiform homogeneously condensed nucleus, a lamellate centriolar adjunct connecting the nucleus with the mid-piece/flagellum, a long flagellum with a 9 + 9 + 2 axoneme pattern and two symmetrical mitochondrial derivatives with an orderly array of peripheral cristae, and two drop-shaped accessory bodies. They may be distinguished by the size of the sperm, and the shape of the nucleus, accessory bodies, and paracrystalline region of mitochondrial derivatives.

Bombus ignitus has now become commercially important as a pollinator because of its use in the agricultural industry, particularly for greenhouse pollination. For long-term management and effective conservation of B.ignitus, an understanding of the genetic structure of its naturally occurring populations is practically important. In this study, the genetic structure among the five populations of B.ignitus in South Korea was assessed using nine microsatellite loci. These markers showed high levels of genetic variability, with the number of alleles ranging from 6 to 22 (mean = 13.4) and the frequency of the most common allele ranging from 0.11 to 0.66. Only the Sabuk (SB) population showed a genetic signature of a recent bottleneck, which was further supported by the lowest level of allelic richness (AR) (mean AR = 3.944). Genetic differentiation was highly significant among all pairs of populations (P {\textless} 0.001) across the nine microsatellite markers, suggesting a lack of gene flow among those populations. Interestingly, F-ST (and R-ST and D-est) values were always greater for the Taebaek population than for the four remaining populations. The phylogenetic analysis showed evidence supporting our hypothesis that the Taebaek population is genetically more divergent than the other populations. Overall, our results suggest that the Korean populations of B.ignitus might have undergone geographic isolation and have become highly separated spatially from one another, thereby having a limited range of migration among their local habitats.},

In this study, we identified 48 bHLH genes in the genome of N. vitripennis. According to phylogenetic analysis, based on N. vitripennis bHLH (NvbHLH) motif sequences and structural domain distribution in their full-length protein sequences, the identified NvbHLH genes were classified into 36 bHLH families with 19, 12, 9, 1, 6, and 1 member(s) in groups A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively. Our classification to the identified NvbHLH family members confirms GenBank annotations for 21 of the 48 NvbHLH proteins and provides useful information for further characterization and annotation of the remaining 27 NvbHLH proteins. Compared to other insect species, N. vitripennis has the lowest number of bHLH family members. No NvbHLH members have been found in the families Net, MyoRa, and PTFa, while all other insect species have at least one member in each of the families. These data constitute a solid basis for further investigations into the functions of bHLH proteins in developmental regulation of N. vitripennis.},

In the six most abundant aphid species, we found an average parasitism rate of migrating aphids close to 1\% and identified seven different, mainly generalist, parasitoid species. We also identified the species and the sex of adult Aphidiinae captured by the suction trap based on morphological criteria. We found that dispersing adult parasitoids were almost exclusively female. Parasitoid dispersal strategy seems to be species-dependant but this result needs to be confirmed by an exhaustive analysis of winged aphids captured. We discuss the possible impact of the low parasitism rate of winged aphids on parasitoid population dynamics and the importance of these results in the context of biological control and of the study of food webs between aphids and their natural enemies.},

In the mainly parasitoid wasp subfamily Doryctinae, gall association, represented by gall inducers, inquilines and their parasitoids, is known for species of seven genera. Previous molecular studies recovered few species of six of these genera as monophyletic despite their disparate morphologies. Here, we reconstructed the evolutionary relationships among 47 species belonging to six gall-associated doryctine genera based on two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene markers. Most of the Bayesian analyses, performed with different levels of incomplete taxa and characters, supported the monophyly of gall-associated doryctines, with Heterospilus (Heterospilini) as sister group. PercnobraconKieffer and Jorgensen and MonitoriellaHedqvist were consistently recovered as monophyletic, and the validity of the monotypic Mononeuron was confirmed with respect to AllorhogasGahan. A nonmonophyletic Allorhogas was recovered, although without significant support. The relationships obtained and the gathered morphological and biological information led us to erect three new genera originally assigned to Psenobolus: Ficobolusgen.n. (F.paniaguaisp.n. and F. jaliscoisp.n.), Plesiopsenobolusgen.n. (Pl. mesoamericanussp.n., Pl. plesiomorphus van Achterberg and Marsh comb.n., and Pl. ticosp.n.), and Sabinitagen.n. (S. mexicanasp.n.). The origin of the gall-associated doryctine clade was estimated to have occurred during the middle Miocene to early Oligocene, 16.33-30.55Ma. Our results support the origin of true gall induction in the Doryctinae from parasitoidism of other gall-forming insects. Moreover, adaptations to attack different gall-forming taxa on various unrelated plant families probably triggered species diversification in the main Allorhogas clade and may also have promoted the independent origin of gall formation on at least three plant groups. Species diversification in the remaining doryctine taxa was probably a result of host shifts within a particular plant taxon and shifts to different plant organs.

In the Atlantic Forest, some species exhibit color variation that seems to be linked with their distribution, with warmer colors (green, with coppery and reddish tones) in lower latitudes and cooler colors (blue, with purple shades) in higher latitudes. Contrasting taxonomic interpretations of this color variation lead to the recognition of distinct species for the different color morphs. In all three case studies investigated in this work (Euglossa iopoecila, Euglossa stellfeldi, and Euglossa townsendi), the different forms were sampled throughout their distribution. Thirty samples from 16 different localities were used, which had their DNA extracted, amplified, and sequenced for fragments of the genes cytochrome b (cytb) and cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (CO1). A concatenated data matrix, totaling 1,089 bp, was submitted for Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. The resulting phylogenetic trees, together with the estimated genetic distances between samples, led to the conclusion that the different color morphs in all the three case studies do not represent separate species, but only integumental color variations of their respective species.},

More than one Vg copy has been reported in several oviparous species, including ants. However, the number and function of different Vgs, their phylogenetic relatedness, and their role in reproductive queens and nonreproductive workers have been studied in few species only. We studied caste-biased expression of Vgs in seven Formica ant species. Only one copy of conventional Vg was identified in Formica species, and three Vg homologs, derived from ancient duplications, which represent yet undiscovered Vg-like genes. We show that each of these Vg-like genes is present in all studied Hymenoptera and some of them in other insects as well. We show that after each major duplication event, at least one of the Vg-like genes has experienced a period of positive selection. This, combined with the observation that the Vg-like genes have acquired or lost specific protein domains suggests sub- or neofunctionalization between Vg and the duplicated genes. In contrast to earlier studies, Vg was not consistently queen biased in its expression, and the caste bias of the three Vg-like genes was highly variable among species. Furthermore, a truncated and Hymenoptera-specific Vg-like gene, Vg-like-C, was consistently worker biased. Multispecies comparisons are essential for Vg expression studies, and for gene expression studies in general, as we show that expression and also, putative functions cannot be generalized even among closely related species.},

Gene inversions were identified in all of these mt genomes; for example, the two rRNA genes have inverted and moved into the nad2-cox1 junction in the Megalyra sp. mt genome.

Although each of the genomes contains a number of repeats of varying size, there was no consistent association of the size or number of repeats with the extent or type of gene rearrangement. The breakpoint distance analysis showed the Evaniomorpha has an intermediate rate of gene rearrangement. Sequence-based phylogenetic analyses of 13 protein-coding and 2 rRNA genes in 22 hymenopteran taxa recovered a paraphyletic Evaniomorpha with the Aculeata nested within it.

	abstract = {Asexual lineages can derive from sexual ancestors via different mechanisms and at variable rates, which affects the diversity of the asexual population and thereby its ecological success. We investigated the variation and evolution of reproductive systems in Aptinothrips, a genus of grass thrips comprising four species. Extensive population surveys and breeding experiments indicated sexual reproduction in A. elegans, asexuality in A. stylifer and A. karnyi, and both sexual and asexual lineages in A. rufus. Asexuality in A. stylifer and A. rufus coincides with a worldwide distribution, with sexual A. rufus lineages confined to a limited area. Inference of molecular phylogenies and antibiotic treatment revealed different causes of asexuality in different species. Asexuality in A. stylifer and A. karnyi has most likely genetic causes, while it is induced by endosymbionts in A. rufus. Endosymbiont-community characterization revealed presence of Wolbachia, and lack of other bacteria known to manipulate host reproduction. However, only 69\% asexual A. rufus females are Wolbachia-infected, indicating that either an undescribed endosymbiont causes asexuality in this species or that Wolbachia was lost in several lineages that remained asexual. These results open new perspectives for studies on the maintenance of mixed sexual and asexual reproduction in natural populations.},

Here, we determine the first complete mitochondrial genome of the Trigonalyidae, from the species Taeniogonalos taihorina (Bischoff, 1914). This mitochondrial genome is 15,927 bp long, with a high A + T-content of 84.60\%. It contains all of the 37 typical animal mitochondrial genes and an A + T-rich region. The orders and directions of all genes are different from those of previously reported hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes. Eight tRNA genes, three protein-coding genes and the A + T-rich region were rearranged, with the. dominant gene rearrangement events being translocation and local inversion. The arrangements of three tRNA clusters, trnY-trnM-trnl-trnQ, trnW-trnL2-trnC, and trnH-trnA-trnR-trnN-trnS-trnE-trnF, and the position of the cox1 gene, are novel to the Hymenoptera, even the insects. Six long intergenic spacers are present in the genome. The secondary structures of the RNA genes are normal, except for trnS2, in which the D-stem pairing is absent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {A calibrated phylogeny of the family Pergidae indicates that the major lineages within the family evolved during the fragmentation of the Gondwanan supercontinent. The split between the Pergidae and its sister group Argidae is estimated at about 153 Myr ago. No central dichotomous division between Australian and South American pergid sawflies was observed, showing that the major lineages within this group had already evolved by the time Australia had become completely isolated from Antarctica. The molecular dating analysis strongly indicates a co-radiation of Australian pergid sawflies with their Myrtaceae hosts and suggest that the two eucalypt-feeding clades, pergines and pterygophorines, colonised their eucalypt host plants independently during the Palaeocene, at the time when their hosts appear to have started radiating. The present analysis includes representatives of 13 of the 14 currently recognised subfamilies of Pergidae, almost all of which are supported by the molecular data presented here. Exceptions include the Euryinae (paraphyletic in respect to Perreyiinae), Acordulecerinae (paraphyletic to the Perginae), and the Australian Phylacteophaginae (placed within the Neotropical Acordulecerinae). The break-up of Gondwana and the timing of the subsequent climatic change in Australia, leading from vegetation adapted to a seasonal-wet conditions to the arid-adapted sclerophyll vegetation typical of Australia, suggest that the species-poor subfamilies occurring in rainforests represent remnants of more diverse groups that were decimated through loss of habitat or host species.

	abstract = {Containing more than a hundred species, the Chrysis ignita species group is the largest and one of the most taxonomically challenging groups in its genus. It has not been possible to resolve the taxonomy of the group using traditional methods due to the lack of robust diagnostic morphological characters. Here we present the results of a molecular analysis designed to delimit species in the Chrysis ignita group for the first time; using mitochondrial sequence data for 364 in-group specimens consisting of all 18 species known to occur in Northern Europe. Two mitochondrial loci were analysed: a COI gene fragment, and a continuous DNA sequence consisting of 16S rRNA, tRNA(Val), 12S rRNA and ND4. Two approaches were employed for delimiting species: ( 1) genetic distance analysis based on the standard COI barcode sequences and; ( 2) phylogenetic analysis of the COI fragment together with rRNA genes. Both analyses yielded trees with similar topology, but support values for nodes were higher using the second approach. Fifteen species were distinguished in all analyses: Chrysis angustula Schenck, 1856, C. brevitarsis Thomson, 1870, C. clarinicollis Linsenmaier, 1951, C. corusca Valkeila, 1971, C. fulgida Linnaeus, 1761, C. ignita ( Linnaeus, 1758), C. impressa Schenck, 1856, C. iris Christ, 1791, C. leptomandibularis Niehuis, 2000, C. longula Abeille de Perrin, 1879, C. ruddii Shuckard, 1837, C. schencki Linsenmaier, 1968, C. subcoriacea Linsenmaier, 1959, C. terminata Dahlbom, 1854 and C. vanlithi Linsenmaier, 1959. The specific status of C. mediata Linsenmaier, 1951 and C. solida Haupt, 1957 was not resolved. Included unidentified specimens grouped in three clusters, two of which are distinctly delimited and apparently represent cryptic species. The specific status of the unidentified samples in the third cluster remained unclear. Moreover, our data suggest the existence of additional cryptic species currently lumped under the names C. pseudobrevitarsis Linsenmaier, 1951 and C. schencki Linsenmaier, 1968. In conclusion, our results derived from analysis of mitochondrial loci strongly support the specific status of the majority of currently recognised species in the Chrysis ignita species group, and suggest the existence of additional cryptic species in Northern Europe. Thus, considering the difficulties that often arise during species determination based on morphological characters, the mtDNA loci used here appear highly suitable for assisting species delimitation in this group as well as identification of specimens.},

Therefore, we investigated the genetic differentiation of the mitochondrial COI gene to clarify the ambiguous taxonomy of this species complex. The 603-bp COI region was sequenced from laboratory-bred colonies and field-collected specimens from seven locations representing five geographical regions in Thailand. DLA was associated with the host Bactrocera correcta while DLB and DLBB were associated with Bactrocera dorsalis. The interspecific nucleotide differences of COI sequences among the three groups ranged from 6.70\% to 7.62\% (Kimura 2-parameter distance), which adequately separates species complexes within the order Hymenoptera and supports the current sibling species classification. The neighbor joining, maximum likelihood and consensus Bayesian phylogenetic trees constructed from COI sequences revealed that the three sibling species of laboratory and field-collected D.longicaudata are monophyletic with 100\% support. The high genetic variation and molecular phylogeny of the COI sequences were shown to discriminate between the D.longicaudata species examined in this study.},

	abstract = {Eusociality has arisen repeatedly and independently in the history of insects, often leading to evolutionary success and ecological dominance. Eusocial wasps of the genera Vespula and Dolichovespula, or yellowjackets, have developed advanced social traits in a relatively small number of species. The origin of traits such as effective paternity and colony size has been interpreted with reference to an established phylogenetic hypothesis that is based on phenotypic data, while the application of molecular evidence to phylogenetic analysis within yellowjackets has been limited. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of yellowjackets on the basis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers (nuclear: 28S, EF1 alpha, Pol II, and wg; mitochondrial: 12S, 16S, COI, COII, and Cytb). We use these data to test the monophyly of yellowjackets and species groups, and resolve species-level relationships within each genus using parsimony and Bayesian inference. Our results indicate that a yellowjacket clade is either weakly supported (parsimony) or rejected (Bayesian inference). However, the monophyly of each yellowjacket genus as well as species groups are strongly supported and concordant between methods. Our results agree with previous studies regarding the monophyly of the Vespula vulgaris group and the sister relationship between the V. rufa and V. squamosa groups. This suggests convergence of large colony size and high effective paternity in the vulgaris group and V. squamosa, or a single origin of both traits in the most recent common ancestor of all Vespula species and their evolutionary reversal in the rufa group.

Despite our increasing knowledge about male mating strategies, we still know little about the signals and cues involved, the sender-receiver relationship and the functional adaptations of the involved sensory systems. Although several authors have noticed a close relationship between the mating system and male-specific elaboration of the visual system, studies on the functional adaptations have yet to be conducted. We investigated the functional morphology of the compound eyes in 11 species of Bombus from various subgenera in detail. Of these, four species (Bombus confusus, Bombus melaleucus, Bombus mendax, Bombus niveatus) have enlarged male eyes, characterized by a higher number of ommatidia compared with worker eyes and a frontal zone with enlarged facets, which is likely to be associated with improved spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity. In these species, perching mating strategies are found. In contrast, males of species that patrol scent routes (Bombus hortorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroeensis, Bombus terrestris, Bombus wurflenii) show no distinct eye adaptations, and their eye morphology closely resembles that of the workers. A phylogenetic analysis of male eye structure indicates that enlarged males eyes may have been the ancestral state in Bombus. (c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London},

Moreover, some species of Copidosoma display polyembryony. Despite their economic and scientific importance, little is known about the phylogeny of Copidosoma and its relations to other groups of Encyrtidae. Here we infer the phylogenetic relationships of this genus from nucleotide sequences of two nuclear (18S and 28S) and one mitochondrial (COI) genes. Forty-four species of Copidosoma and three species of Copidosomopsis plus two outgroup species are included in Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Copidosomopsis syn. n. is proposed as a junior synonym of Copidosoma based on phylogenetic analysis results. Each of nine identical clades, resulting from both analyses, is proposed as informal species group: cervius group (cervius, chalconotum and serricorne), recovered as the basal lineage of Copidosoma; nacoleiae group (nacoleaie, meridionalis and an undescribed species, formerly belonging to the genus Copidosomopsis); boucheanum group (boucheanum, terebrator, peticus, phaloniae, ancharus, tibiale and sosares); noyesi group (noyesi and probably undescribed related species); albipes group (albipes and coimbatorense); varicorne group (including varicorne and subalbicorne in one subclade, and aretas and fuscisquama in the other); thebe group (thebe and probably undescribed related species); exiguum group (exiguum and probably undescribed related species); floridanum group (floridanum, primulum, transversum, truncatellum and agrotis).

These parasitoids occur in natural and agricultural ecosystems throughout the Palaearctic and parasitize aphid hosts belonging to the tribe Macrosiphini. The P. dorsale-yomenae species complex represents a morphologically cryptic group, consisting of several hidden taxa with specific host adaptations and distributions. For the morphometric analyses we used a large dataset comprising 230 female specimens that emerged from 30 different species of aphid hosts throughout the Palaearctic. The molecular analysis included a reduced dataset of 44 specimens that emerged from 19 aphid hosts. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and the nuclear second expansion segment of the 285 rRNA gene (28SD2) were used to estimate a genetic diversity within this complex. Although all Praon species clustered closely together in the 28SD2 tree, confirming their close relatedness, the molecular characterization based on COI identified five clearly separate taxa with sequence divergences in the range of 4.7-8.9\%. These taxa also exhibited significant differences in forewing shape as revealed by geometric morphometric analyses. Classical morphometric analyses revealed the length of m-cu vein as a new taxonomic character, but suggested that one commonly used trait, the color pattern of the Rs + M and m-cu veins, cannot be used for species distinction as it was highly variable in one of the taxa. Based on the combined morphometric and genetic data, we confirm the species status of Praon dorsale, P. yomenae, P. longicorne and P. volucre, and describe and illustrate a new parasitoid species of the “dorsale-yomenae” group, i.e. Praon staticobii n.sp. associated with Staticobium limonii on Limonium angustifolium.

	abstract = {Encarsia formosa Gahan is a common parasitoid of Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood and Bemisia tabasi Gennadius (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) which has extensively been used for biological control programs in greenhouses. Apart from the behavioral and molecular variations among members of luteola species-group, it is noticeable that E. formosa is the only telytokous species due to prevalence of a maternally inherited parthenogenesis-inducing (PI) bacteria called Wolbachia whereas males are common in other species of luteola group. In this study, the validity of COI and D2-28S rRNA genes to characterize Iranian E. formosa in correct species-group was addressed based on parsimonious analysis. The variation of Wolbachia endosymbiont of E. formosa populations corresponding to other hosts has also been carried out. Furthermore, the characterization of the Wolbachia supergroup, subgroup and strain were studied based on wsp gene and HVRs. In COI-based phylogeny of Encarsia the positions of Iranian populations were not determined in correct grouping near GenBank E. formosa and E. luteola in luteola species-group but D2-28S rRNA could differentiate all populations with high accuracy in luteola group. The phylogenetic relationship among strains of Wolbachia indicated that all of them were belonged to supergroup B, strain wFor and subgroup For, based on wsp gene through Neighbor-Joining analysis. While wsp gene sequence alone was sufficient to characterize Wolbachia in our populations but studies on MLST comprising genes (CoxA, gatB, fbpA, fcpA and ftsZ) is undergoing.},

	abstract = {The platygastroid wasp Echthrodesis lamorali has been of considerable interest since its description in 1968, primarily because of its highly modified, densely pilose, wingless body, its distribution and unusual biology. The species is endemic to the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, where it is an endoparasitoid of eggs of the marine spiders Desis formidabilis (Desidae) and Amaurobioides africanus (Anyphaenidae) in the intertidal region. Although a highly aberrant monospecific genus, the phylogenetic relationships of Echthrodesis are confused, in part due to convergence in body form across numerous unrelated platygastroid genera. We used sequence data from the nuclear 28S rRNA and 18S rDNA genes, and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) gene, to determine the phylogenetic affinities of E. lamorali. We present a revised taxonomic description for the genus and species, as well as new morphological information on the structure of its mouthparts and ovipositor system. Phylogenetic analyses of molecular data place E. lamorali within one of two independent clades of platygastroid wasps that use spider eggs as hosts. Echthrodesis is sister to a group of three genera: Neobaeus (New Zealand; host unconfirmed); Mirobaeoides (Australia; spider eggs); and Embidobia (near cosmopolitan; embiid eggs). Details on the biology, behaviour and morphological adaptations of E. lamorali are provided.},

Multiple alignments and a phylogenetic analysis of GS sequences showed that AccGS belongs to the GSII superfamily and clusters with invertebrate GSs. Real-time quantitative PCR data demonstrated that AccGS is expressed at all developmental stages and in all tissues, with the highest expression observed in the sixth larval instar and in the brain. Moreover, AccGS expression is highly regulated by environmental stress, including xenobiotic, temperature, and ultraviolet light stresses. A disc diffusion assay showed that the recombinant AccGS protein confers resistance to mercuric chloride (HgCl2) stress in E. coli. This suggests that AccGS may play multiple roles in early development and in environmental stress responses.},

Rearing records indicate that individual species are restricted to attack hosts within only one of these four main groups. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the group using sequence data from multiple genes (18S, 28S, COI, EF-1) to assess the pattern of shifts among host groups and to test the monophyly of and relationships among genera and species-groups. Telenominae sensuMasnerthat is, including only the nominate tribe Telenominiis not monophyletic. Representatives of the Psix group of genera (PsixKozlov \& Le and ParatelenomusDodd) form a monophyletic group that is sister to GryonHaliday (Scelioninae: Gryonini) and are excluded from the subfamily. The remaining telenomines are monophyletic. The genus PhanuromyiaDodd and the crassiclava group of TelenomusHaliday, both recorded as parasitoids of planthopper eggs (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha, Fulgoroidea), form a monophyletic group that is sister to all other telenomines exclusive of the Psix group. Twenty-nine species of the crassiclava and aradi groups of Telenomus are transferred to Phanuromyia as new combinations. Basal elements of the remaining species are all in groups reared from the eggs of true bugs (Heteroptera), primarily the stink bugs (Pentatomoidea) and seed bugs (Lygaeoidea). A shift to parasitism of lepidopteran eggs evolved within a single clade, occurring either one or two times. From this clade a small group of species, the Telenomus tabanivorus group, subsequently shifted to parasitism of egg masses of true flies (Tabanidae and Stratiomyiidae). AholcusKieffer and PlatytelenomusDodd both belong to the clade of lepidopteran parasitoids and are considered as junior synonyms of Telenomus (new synonymy for Aholcus). The monophyletic status of the two core genera, Telenomus and Trissolcus could not be resolved using these data. The phylogenetic pattern of host shifts suggests comparisons among taxa that may be fruitful in elucidating mechanisms by which parasitoids locate their hosts, the proximate factors that determine the host range, and the changes in these factors that influence host changes.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-13-263},
	abstract = {Background: The Pleistocene climatic oscillations are considered as a major driving force of intraspecific divergence and speciation. During Ice Ages, populations isolated in allopatric glacial refugia can experience differentiation in reproductive traits through divergence in selection regimes. This phenomenon may lead to reproductive isolation and dramatically accentuates the consequences of the climatic oscillations on species. Alternatively, when reproductive isolation is incomplete and populations are expanding again, further mating between the formerly isolated populations can result in the formation of a hybrid zone, genetic introgression or reinforcement speciation through reproductive trait displacements. Therefore changes in reproductive traits driven by population movements during climatic oscillations can act as an important force in promoting pre-zygotic isolation. Notwithstanding, divergence of reproductive traits has not been approached in the context of climatic oscillations. Here we investigate the impact of population movements driven by climatic oscillations on a reproductive trait of a bumblebee species (Bombus lapidarius). We characterise the pattern of variation and differentiation across the species distribution (i) with five genes (nuclear and mitochondrial), and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees. Results: Our results provide evidence that populations have experienced a genetic allopatric differentiation, in at least three main refugia (the Balkans, Centre-Eastern Europe, and Southern Italy) during Quaternary glaciations. The comparative chemical analyses show that populations from the Southern Italian refugium have experienced MMS differentiation and an incipient speciation process from another refugium. The meeting of Southern Italian populations with other populations as a result of range expansion at a secondary contact zone seems to have led to a reinforcement process on local MMS patterns. Conclusions: This study suggests that population movement during Quaternary climatic oscillations can lead to divergence in reproductive traits by allopatric differentiation during Ice Ages and by reinforcement during post-glacial recolonization.},

Synanthropically, it has become one of the most important insect pests of wheat grown in the northern Great Plains region of the USA and Canada. Insecticides are generally ineffective because of the wheat stem sawfly's extended adult flight period and its inaccessible larval stage, during which it feeds within the wheat stems, making it virtually intractable to most pest management strategies. While research towards integrated pest management strategies based on insect olfaction has proved promising, nothing is known about the molecular basis of olfaction in this important pest species. In this study we identified 28 unique odorant receptor (Or) transcripts from an antennal transcriptome. A phylogenetic analysis with the predicted Ors from the honey bee and jewel wasp genomes revealed at least four clades conserved amongst all three Hymenoptera species. Antennal expression levels were analysed using quantitative real-time PCR, and one male-biased and five female-biased Ors were identified. This study provides the basis for future functional analyses to identify behaviourally active odours that can be used to help develop olfactory-mediated pest management tools.},

Phasmatodea are chewing herbivores with an elongated body shape, which camouflages them on the vegetation on which they feed. This work evaluated the gut structure of the walking stick insect, Cladomorphus phyllinus (Gray 1835) (Phasmatoidea: Phasmidae), with light and scanning electron microscopy. The digestive tract of C. phillynus is an elongated tube with minimal external anatomical differences along its length. There is a short gastric caeca-like structure in the posterior midgut. The crop is an extensively folded storage organ and the proventriculus is covered by a thick cuticle with spine-like projections, which play a role in grinding food. The midgut has 2 anatomical regions probably involved in digestion and absorption of nutrients. The epithelial cells of the anterior midgut have bubbles of apocrine secretion, while the posterior midgut cells have a striated border. Gastric caecae-like projections are found in the posterior midgut. They are enlarged close to the midgut wall, and follow a thin and long filament, which is free in the body cavity. The epithelial cells lining the gastric caecae-like projections are cuboidal with well development striated borders, suggesting involvement in nutrient absorption. The hindgut is divided in an ileum and a rectum. The ileum epithelial cells are covered by cuticle and have cytological traits characteristic of electrolyte and water absorption. The rectum epithelial cells have no obvious absorptive features, but the rectal pads may be involved in water and electrolyte reabsorption. This work reinforces the concept that the anatomy of gut is related to the diet and body shape, and shows that the general pattern of compartmentalization of digestion in insects was maintained in Phasmatodea, but that it differs from other Orthopteroidea in some aspects.},

After digitizing landmarks on the right fore wings, 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinates were calculated and by Procrustes analysis the coordinates were standardized and superimposed. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) were performed to show the distribution of all species. Then, deformations which appeared in thin-plate splines were observed. Mean values of all the specimens were calculated and Sequential, Agglomerative, Hierarchical, and Nesting clustering method (SAHN) was performed with these data to obtain the dissimilarity trees. It can be concluded that all species were found to have consistently different wing shapes from each other. In females, the species B. armeniacus, B. mesomelas and B. pomorum which resemble each other, were also found to be similar based on their wing morphometry. Both in females and males, the subspecies B. sylvarum citrinofasciatus and B. sylvarum daghestanicus and the species B. humilis and B. laesus exposed high similarity in wing morphometry.

Results from sequence analysis showed that this gene is 1,563 bp long, and that the ORF encodes 520 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 58.02 kDa, and has a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.83. Furthermore, there are two putative transmembrane domains. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that the AccSNMP1 gene from A. cerana cerana had different degrees of identity with the corresponding genes in nineteen other insects at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis of the aligned sequences showed that A. cerana cerana is closely related to Apis mellifera Linnaeus and Bombus impatiens Cresson. Its distribution in tissues, as quantified using real-time RT-PCR, indicated that AccSNMP1 is highly expressed in the antennae and legs of A. cerana cerana, and there was a significant difference (p {\textless} 0.05) in gene expression between those tissues and tissues in the thorax, abdomen, snout, and head (not including antennae). Western blotting also confirmed the existence in the antennae of AccSNMP1 with an M (W) of 58.0 kDa, which is the same as the expected value of 58.02 kDa. An immunohistochemistry study showed that AccSNMP1 is expressed in the trichoid sensilla of A. cerana cerana antenna.

The full-length cDNA consisted of 725 bp, and encoded a protein of 204 amino acids. Homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that AccFABP was a member of the FABP multifamily. The genomic structure of this gene, which was common among FABP multifamily members, spanned 1,900 bp, and included four exons and three introns. Gene expression analysis revealed that AccFABP was highly expressed in the dark-pigmented phase of pupal development, with peak expression observed in the fat bodies of the dark-pigmented phase pupae. The AccFABP transcripts in the fat body were upregulated by exposure to dietary fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and arachidonic acid. Transcription factor binding sites for Caudal-Related Homeobox and functional CCAAT/enhancer binding site, which were respectively associated with tissue expression and lipid metabolism, were detected in the 5' promoter sequence.

	abstract = {Morphological convergence is a frequently observed pattern that occurs in species with similar environments, trophic niches, and/or life history strategies. In particular, adaptive morphological convergence is common in small, highly diverse invertebrate taxa sharing similar life history strategies such as parasitoidism. The genus Notiospathius is a braconid parasitoid wasp group with a vast, undetermined number of species distributed throughout the Neotropics. Members of this genus possess a considerably elongated, petiolate first metasomal tergite. This structure, however, also occurs in species of other doryctine genera, both closely and distantly related, probably due to adaptation for attacking wood and bark boring coleopteran larvae. Here we investigated the phylogenetic relationships among 117 species assigned to Notiospathius, including species of its closely related genera Masonius and Tarasco, as well as members of a number of other dotyctine genera in order to test its monophyly. Separate and concatenated Bayesian partitioned analyses were carried out using two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene markers. The influence of each gene on the overall topology was verified using a cross-validation analysis for each marker with a “leave-one-out” approach. Moreover, the historical biogeography of Notiospathius was assessed calculating divergence time estimates of clades with BEAST and performing ancestral area reconstruction analyses both with RASP (Bayesian and S-DIVA) and Lagrange (DEC). All analyses recovered a polyphyletic Notiospathius consisting of three separate clades that were more related to other doryctine genera than to each other. The relationships reconstructed could not be used to confidently establish the limits of Notiospathius with respect to its closely related genera Tarasco and Masonius, and thus the generic status of the latter two taxa is maintained. Our divergence time estimates and ancestral area reconstructions indicate that the most recent common ancestor of Notiospathius sensu stricto originated in the Caribbean subregion during the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, and subsequently diversified during the mid- to late Miocene, radiating throughout the Neotropics.

Diffusive coevolution might maintain stable cooperation in a fig-fig wasps system, in which the exploiter might diversify their genotype, phenotype, or behavior as a result of competition with pollinator, whereas the figs change flower syconia, fruits thickness, and syconia structure. In functionally dioecious Ficus auriculata, male figs and female figs contain two types of florets on separate plant, and share high similarities in outside morphology. Apocryptophagus (Sycophaginae, Chalcidoidea, Hymenoptera) is one of few groups of nonpollinating fig wasps that can reproduce within both male and female figs. On the basis of the morphology and DNA barcoding, evidence from partial sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I and nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2, we found that there are two nonsibling Apocryptophagus species living on male and female F. auriculata figs, respectively. We estimated that these two species diverged about 19.2 million years ago. Our study suggests that the host shift from Ficus variegate or Ficus prostrata fig species to male figs is a preference way for Apocryptophagus wasps to adapt to the separation of sexual function in diecious figs. Furthermore, to escape the disadvantage or sanction impact of the host, the exploiter Apocryptophagus wasps can preferably adapt to exploiting each sex of the figs, by changing their oviposition, niche shift, and habitat.},

	abstract = {Chemical compounds are highly important in the ecology of animals. In social insects, compounds on the body surface represent a particularly interesting trait, because they comprise different compound classes that are involved in different functions, such as communication, recognition and protection, all of which can be differentially affected by evolutionary processes. Here, we investigate the widely unknown and possibly antagonistic influence of phylogenetic and environmental factors on the composition of the cuticular chemistry of tropical stingless bees. We chose stingless bees because some species are unique in expressing not only self-produced compounds, but also compounds that are taken up from the environment. By relating the cuticular chemistry of 40 bee species from all over the world to their molecular phylogeny and geographical occurrence, we found that distribution patterns of different groups of compounds were differentially affected by genetic relatedness and biogeography. The ability to acquire environmental compounds was, for example, highly correlated with the bees' phylogeny and predominated in evolutionarily derived species. Owing to the presence of environmentally derived compounds, those species further expressed a higher chemical and thus functional diversity. In Old World species, chemical similarity of both environmentally derived and self-produced compounds was particularly high among sympatric species, even when they were less related to each other than to allopatric species, revealing a strong environmental effect even on largely genetically determined compounds. Thus, our findings do not only reveal an unexpectedly strong influence of the environment on the cuticular chemistry of stingless bees, but also demonstrate that even within one morphological trait (an insect's cuticular profile), different components (compound classes) can be differentially affected by different drivers (relatedness and biogeography), depending on the functional context.},

	abstract = {Background: Bees are the primary pollinators of angiosperms throughout the world. There are more than 16,000 described species, with broad variation in life history traits such as nesting habitat, diet, and social behavior. Despite their importance as pollinators, the evolution of bee biodiversity is understudied: relationships among the seven families of bees remain controversial, and no empirical global-level reconstruction of historical biogeography has been attempted. Morphological studies have generally suggested that the phylogeny of bees is rooted near the family Colletidae, whereas many molecular studies have suggested a root node near (or within) Melittidae. Previous molecular studies have focused on a relatively small sample of taxa (similar to 150 species) and genes (seven at most). Public databases contain an enormous amount of DNA sequence data that has not been comprehensively analysed in the context of bee evolution. Results: We downloaded, aligned, concatenated, and analysed all available protein-coding nuclear gene DNA sequence data in GenBank as of October, 2011. Our matrix consists of 20 genes, with over 17,000 aligned nucleotide sites, for over 1,300 bee and apoid wasp species, representing over two-thirds of bee genera. Whereas the matrix is large in terms of number of genes and taxa, there is a significant amount of missing data: only similar to 15\% of the matrix is populated with data. The placement of the root as well as relationships between Andrenidae and other bee families remain ambiguous, as several alternative maximum-likelihood estimates fall within the statistically credible set. However, we recover strong bootstrap support for relationships among many families and for their monophyly. Ancestral geographic range reconstruction suggests a likely origin of bees in the southern hemisphere, with Melittidae ancestrally located within Africa, and Halictidae, Colletidae, and Apidae within the New World. Conclusions: Our study affirms the monophyly of each bee family, sister-taxa relationships between Apidae and Megachilidae (the `long-tongued bees'), between Colletidae and Stenotritidae, and between Colletidae + Stenotritidae and Halictidae. Our analyses reject a Colletidae-basal hypothesis for family-level relationships and instead support Melittidae as sister to the remaining bees. Southern hemisphere vicariance likely played an important role in early diversification within many bee families.},

Identifying queen pheromones in multiple species would give new insight into the selective pressures and evolutionary constraints acting on these ubiquitous signals. Here, we present experimental and comparative evidence that 3-methylalkanes, hydrocarbons present on the queen's cuticle, are a queen pheromone throughout the ant genus Lasius. Interspecific variation in the chemical profile is consistent with 3-methylalkanes evolving more slowly than other types of hydrocarbons, perhaps due to differential selection or evolutionary constraints. We argue that the sensory ecology of the worker response imposes strong stabilizing selection on queen pheromones relative to other hydrocarbons. 3-Methylalkanes are also strongly physiologically and genetically coupled with fecundity in at least one Lasius species, which may translate into evolutionary constraints. Our results highlight how honest signalling could minimize evolutionary conflict over reproduction, promoting the evolution and maintenance of eusociality.},

	doi = {10.1186/1742-9994-10-36},
	abstract = {Background: Ecological constraints related to foraging are expected to affect the evolution of morphological traits relevant to food capture, manipulation and transport. Females of central-place foraging Hymenoptera vary in their food load manipulation ability. Bees and social wasps modulate the amount of food taken per foraging trip (in terms of e. g. number of pollen grains or parts of prey), while solitary wasps carry exclusively entire prey items. We hypothesized that the foraging constraints acting on females of the latter species, imposed by the upper limit to the load size they are able to transport in flight, should promote the evolution of a greater load-lifting capacity and manoeuvrability, specifically in terms of greater flight muscle to body mass ratio and lower wing loading. Results: Our comparative study of 28 species confirms that, accounting for shared ancestry, female flight muscle ratio was significantly higher and wing loading lower in species taking entire prey compared to those that are able to modulate load size. Body mass had no effect on flight muscle ratio, though it strongly and negatively co-varied with wing loading. Across species, flight muscle ratio and wing loading were negatively correlated, suggesting coevolution of these traits. Conclusions: Natural selection has led to the coevolution of resource load manipulation ability and morphological traits affecting flying ability with additional loads in females of central-place foraging Hymenoptera. Release from load-carrying constraints related to foraging, which took place with the evolution of food load manipulation ability, has selected against the maintenance of a powerful flight apparatus. This could be the case since investment in flight muscles may have to be traded against other life-history traits, such as reproductive investment.},

Particularly, several species of the genus Trichogramma are widely used as biological control agents in integrated agricultural pest management programs in Mexico. The identification of trichogrammatid wasps based on morphological characters is complicated. A feasible alternative to those taxonomic problems is the utilization of molecular techniques. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to differentiate the most common genera of Trichogrammatidae, and infer their phylogeny, based on the molecular markers ITS2 and 18S of the rDNA and COII of the mDNA. Thus, individual wasps of Ittys, Aphelinoidea, Paracentrobia, Pseudoligosita, Ufens, Burksiella, Zagella, and Trichogramma were subjected to DNA extraction, DNA amplification by PCR, and phylogenetic analysis by the maximum parsimony (MP) method, based on the use of the molecular markers ITS2 and 18S of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and COII of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA). PCR-product sizes of the region ITS2 varied from 450 to 700 bp for the more common genera of Trichogrammatidae from Mexico, which is useful for the taxonomic studies of these parasitic wasps. On the contrary, PCR-product sizes of the regions 18S and COII did not vary among genera, whose values were about 790 and 300 bp, respectively. PCR-product sizes of the regions ITS2 Y COII for most of trichogrammatid genera are reported for the first time. Phylogenies obtained based on the sequences of the ITS2 region were congruent with the current classification of Trichogrammatidae based on morphological characters.},

We used phylogenetic regression methods to compare the relative importance of ecology versus phylogeny on associations between Heterarthrinae leafmining sawflies and their parasitoids. We found that: (1) the origin of leafmining led to escape from most parasitoids attacking external-feeding sawflies; (2) the current enemies mainly consist of generalists that are shared with other leafmining taxa, and of more specialized lineages that may have diversified by shifting among heterarthrines; and (3) parasitoidleafminer associations are influenced more by the phylogeny of the miners' host plants than by relationships among miner species. Our results suggest that vertical diversifying forces have a significantbut not ubiquitousrole in speciation: many of the parasitoids have remained polyphagous despite niche diversification in the miners, and heterarthrine host shifts also seem to be strongly affected by host availability.},

	abstract = {The animal gut is a habitat for diverse communities of microorganisms (microbiota). Honeybees and bumblebees have recently been shown to harbour a distinct and species poor microbiota, which may confer protection against parasites. Here, we investigate diversity, host specificity and transmission mode of two of the most common, yet poorly known, gut bacteria of honeybees and bumblebees: Snodgrassella alvi (Betaproteobacteria) and Gilliamella apicola (Gammaproteobacteria). We analysed 16S rRNA gene sequences of these bacteria from diverse bee host species across most of the honeybee and bumblebee phylogenetic diversity from North America, Europe and Asia. These focal bacteria were present in 92\% of bumblebee species and all honeybee species but were found to be absent in the two related corbiculate bee tribes, the stingless bees (Meliponini) and orchid bees (Euglossini). Both Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola phylogenies show significant topological congruence with the phylogeny of their bee hosts, albeit with a considerable degree of putative host switches. Furthermore, we found that phylogenetic distances between Gilliamella apicola samples correlated with the geographical distance between sampling locations. This tentatively suggests that the environmental transmission rate, as set by geographical distance, affects the distribution of G.apicola infections. We show experimentally that both bacterial taxa can be vertically transmitted from the mother colony to daughter queens, and social contact with nest mates after emergence from the pupa greatly facilitates this transmission. Therefore, sociality may play an important role in vertical transmission and opens up the potential for co-evolution or at least a close association of gut bacteria with their hosts.},

	abstract = {The eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1 alpha gene (eEF1A) has been used extensively in higher level phylogenetics of insects and other groups, despite being present in two or more copies in several taxa. Orthology assessment has relied heavily on the position of introns, but the basic assumption of low rates of intron loss and absence of convergent intron gains has not been tested thoroughly. Here, we study the evolution of eEF1A based on a broad sample of taxa in the insect order Hymenoptera. The gene is universally present in two copies - F1 and F2 - both of which apparently originated before the emergence of the order. An elevated ratio of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions and differences in rates of amino acid replacements between the copies suggest that they evolve independently, and phylogenetic methods clearly cluster the copies separately. The F2 copy appears to be ancient; it is orthologous with the copy known as F1 in Diptera, and is likely present in most insect orders. The hymenopteran F1 copy, which may or may not be unique to this order, apparently originated through retroposition and was originally intron free. During the evolution of the Hymenoptera, it has successively accumulated introns, at least three of which have appeared at the same position as introns in the F2 copy or in eEF1A copies in other insects. The sites of convergent intron gain are characterized by highly conserved nucleotides that strongly resemble specific intron-associated sequence motifs, so-called proto-splice sites. The significant rate of convergent intron gain renders intron-exon structure unreliable as an indicator of orthology in eEF1A, and probably also in other protein-coding genes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-13-74},
	abstract = {Background: The diversification of organisms with a parasitic lifestyle is often tightly linked to the evolution of their host associations. If a tight host association exists, closely related species tend to attack closely related hosts; host associations are less stable if associations are determined by more plastic traits like parasitoid searching and oviposition behaviour. The pupal-parasitoids of the genus Ichneumon attack a variety of macrolepidopteran hosts. They are either monophagous or polyphagous, and therefore offer a promissing system to investigate the evolution of host associations. Ichneumon was previously divided into two groups based on general body shape; however, a stout shape has been suggested as an adaptation to buried host pupation sites, and might thus not represent a reliable phylogenetic character. Results: We here reconstruct the first molecular phylogeny of the genus Ichneumon using two mitochondrial (CO1 and NADH1) and one nuclear marker (28S). The resulting phylogeny only supports monophyly of Ichneumon when Ichneumon lugens Gravenhorst, 1829 (formerly in Chasmias, stat. rev.) and Ichneumon deliratorius Linnaeus, 1758 (formerly Coelichneumon) are included. Neither parasitoid species that attack hosts belonging to one family nor those attacking butterflies (Rhopalocera) form monophyletic clades. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest multiple transitions between searching for hosts above versus below ground and between a stout versus elongated body shape. A model assuming correlated evolution between the two characters was preferred over independent evolution of host-searching niche and body shape. Conclusions: Host relations, both in terms of phylogeny and ecology, evolved at a high pace in the genus Ichneumon. Numerous switches between hosts of different lepidopteran families have occurred, a pattern that seems to be the rule among idiobiont parasitoids. A stout body and antennal shape in the parasitoid female is confirmed as an ecological adaptation to host pupation sites below ground and has evolved convergently several times. Morphological characters that might be involved in adaptation to hosts should be avoided as diagnostic characters for phylogeny and classification, as they can be expected to show high levels of homoplasy.},

We explore the effect of placing a hard upper age bound near the root of the tree and the effect of different topologies on our divergence time estimates.

To investigate the intraspecific variability and to ascertain cryptic speciation within the Praon abjectum Haliday group, biotypes in association with the aphid hosts Aphis sambuci L., Longicaudus trirhodus Walker, and Rhopalosiphum spp. were examined. We combined molecular and geometric morphometric analyses, that is, partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and nuclear 28SD2 genes and the shape of the forewing. Low variation of 28SD2 sequences confirmed the close relatedness of species from the genus Praon. Analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I sequences however identified three separate taxa within the P. abjectum group with substantial genetic divergence. The biotype of P. abjectum associated with L. trirhodus differed from those associated with Rhopalosiphum sp. and A. sambuci by 5.4-6.5\% and 7.7\% sequence divergence, respectively, while the genetic distance between the latter two biotypes ranged from 9.5 to 10\%. The main changes in the forewing shape that discriminate these three biotypes as revealed by geometric morphometrics are related to the stigma shape and the position of the radial nerve. Based on the differences determined in mitochondrial sequences and in the shape of the wing, we describe two new cryptic species within the P. abjectum group as follows: P. sambuci sp. n. in association with A. sambuci/S. nigra and P. longicaudus sp. n. in association with L. trirhodus/T. aquilegifolium.},

One driver of this diversity is the evolution of host-species specificity, which can occur via reproductive isolation following a host-switch or, given the correct circumstances, via cospeciation. In this study, we explored the diversity and evolutionary history of Acrostichus nematodes that are associated with halictid bees in North America. First, we conducted surveys of bees in Virginia, and found six halictid species that host Acrostichus. To test the hypothesis of cospeciation, we constructed phylogenetic hypotheses of Acrostichus based on three genes. We found Acrostichus purl and Acrostichus halicti to be species complexes comprising cryptic, host-specific species. Although several nodes in the host and symbiont phylogenies were congruent and tests for cospeciation were significant, the host's biogeography, the apparent patchiness of the association across the host's phylogeny, and the amount of evolution in the nematode sequence suggested a mixture of cospeciation, host switching, and extinction events instead of strict cospeciation. Cospeciation can explain the relationships between Ac. purl and its augochlorine hosts, but colonization of Halictus hosts is more likely than cospeciation. The nematodes are vertically transmitted, but sexual transmission is also likely. Both of these transmission modes may explain host-species specificity and congruent bee and nematode phylogenies. Additionally, all halictid hosts come from eusocial or socially polymorphic lineages, suggesting that sociality may be a factor in the suitability of hosts for Acrostichus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

	doi = {10.1186/gb-2013-14-12-r142},
	abstract = {Background: Taxa that harbor natural phenotypic variation are ideal for ecological genomic approaches aimed at understanding how the interplay between genetic and environmental factors can lead to the evolution of complex traits. Lasioglossum albipes is a polymorphic halictid bee that expresses variation in social behavior among populations, and common-garden experiments have suggested that this variation is likely to have a genetic component. Results: We present the L. albipes genome assembly to characterize the genetic and ecological factors associated with the evolution of social behavior. The de novo assembly is comparable to other published social insect genomes, with an N50 scaffold length of 602 kb. Gene families unique to L. albipes are associated with integrin-mediated signaling and DNA-binding domains, and several appear to be expanded in this species, including the glutathione-s-transferases and the inositol monophosphatases. L. albipes has an intact DNA methylation system, and in silico analyses suggest that methylation occurs primarily in exons. Comparisons to other insect genomes indicate that genes associated with metabolism and nucleotide binding undergo accelerated evolution in the halictid lineage. Whole-genome resequencing data from one solitary and one social L. albipes female identify six genes that appear to be rapidly diverging between social forms, including a putative odorant receptor and a cuticular protein. Conclusions: L. albipes represents a novel genetic model system for understanding the evolution of social behavior. It represents the first published genome sequence of a primitively social insect, thereby facilitating comparative genomic studies across the Hymenoptera as a whole.},

The braconid subfamily Doryctinae is perhaps where this feature has evolved the most times independently. Here we recognise a new Neotropical doryctine wasp genus with a petiolate first metasomal tergum, based on molecular and morphological analysis. The phylogenetic affinities of the new genus within Doryctinae and the relationships among six of its described and three potentially cryptic, undescribed species were reconstructed using sequence data from three genes, wingless, 28SrDNA and COI. The new genus is resolved in a clade together with Semirhytus Szepligeti, Johnsonius Marsh and Parallorhogas Marsh. These four genera share vein m-cu of the hind wing slightly curved distally and the propodeum with a distinct lateral and median longitudinal carina and an apical areola. The relationships recovered among the examined species suggest a South American origin for the new genus and its subsequent diversification into Central America and Mexico. Described as Bolivar, gen. nov., this new taxon comprises eight species, two species previously placed within Notiospathius Matthews \& Marsh, B. ornaticornis (Cameron), comb. nov., and B. bribri (Marsh), comb. nov., and six new species (B. ecuadorensis, sp. nov., B. helmuthi, sp. nov., B. pittieri, sp. nov., B. risaraldae, sp. nov., B. teres, sp. nov. and B. tuxtlae, sp. nov.).},

Confocal laser scanning microscopy is the primary method used for illustrating anatomical phenotypes, and a domain-specific anatomy ontology is employed to more explicitly describe anatomical structures. A comprehensive data set of ceraphronoid male genitalia is analyzed, yielding the first phylogeny of the superfamily. One hundred and one taxa, including three outgroups, are scored for 48 characters. Ceraphronoidea are recovered as sister to the remaining Evaniomorpha in the implied weighting analyses. Numerous character states suggest that Ceraphronoidea is a relatively basal apocritan lineage. Ceraphronoidea, Ceraphronidae, and Megaspilinae are each retrieved as monophyletic in all analyses. Megaspilidae is not recovered as monophyletic. Lagynodinae is monophyletic in the implied weighting analyses with strong support and is a polytomy in the equal weighting analysis. Lagynodinae shares numerous plesiomorphies with both Megaspilinae and Ceraphronidae. Relationships among genera are weakly corroborated. Masner is sister of Ceraphronidae. Trassedia is nested within Ceraphronidae based on the present analysis. Because of this and numerous features shared between it and Ceraphron we transfer Trassedia from Megaspilidae to Ceraphronidae. Dendrocerus forms a single monophyletic clade, with modest support, together with some Conostigmus species. This result challenges the utility of such traditional diagnostic characters as ocellar arrangement and shape of the male flagellomeres. Aphanogmus is monophyletic in the implied weighting, but remains a polytomy with Ceraphron in the equal weighting analysis. Gnathoceraphron is always nested within a well-supported Aphanogmus clade. Cyoceraphron and Elysoceraphron are nested within Ceraphron and Aphanogmus, respectively. The male genitalia prove to be a substantial source of phylogenetically relevant information. Our results indicate that a reclassification of Ceraphronoidea both at the family and generic level is necessary but that more data are required.},

Here, a revised and expanded morphological dataset incorporating several new taxa is used to test ophrynopine relationships and provide further insights into their evolutionary history. The analyses largely corroborate previous results. The distribution pattern and the fossil record indicate that the ophrynopines radiated in the early Cenozoic in the Australasian-Oceanian and the Neotropic regions and later dispersed into the Nearctic, Eastern Palaearctic and Indomalayan regions. The South American genus Ophrella Middlekauff, 1985 is well supported as a monophyletic genus, whereas Ophrynopus Konow, 1897 is paraphyletic with respect to Stirocorsia Konow, 1897.

Although Ceraphronoidea is one of the most commonly collected Hymenoptera taxa with considerable economic importance, our knowledge about their natural history and phylogenetic relationships, both to other apocritan lineages and within the superfamily itself, is limited. As a first step towards revealing ceraphronoid natural diversity we describe the skeletomuscular system of the ceraphronoid ovipositor for the first time. Dissections and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy 3D media files were used to visualize the ovipositor complex and to develop character concepts. Morphological structures were described in natural language and then translated into a character-character state format, whose terminology was linked to phenotype-relevant ontologies. Pour unique anatomical phenotypes were revealed: 1. The first valvifer (gonangulum) of the genus Trassedia is composed of two articulating sclerites, a condition present only in a few basal insect taxa. The bipartition of the first valvifer in Trassedia is most likely secondary and might allow more rapid oviposition. 2. Ceraphronoids, unlike other Hymenoptera, lack the retractor muscle of the terebra; instead the egg laying device is retracted by the seventh sternite. 3. Also unlike other Hymenoptera, the cordate apodeme and the anterior flange of the second valvifer are fused and compose one ridge that serves as the site of attachment for the dorsal and ventral T9-second valvifer muscles. Overall, the ceraphronoid ovipositor system is highly variable and can be described by discrete, distinguishable character states. However, these differences, despite their discrete nature, do not reflect the present classification of the superfamily and might represent parallelisms driven by host biology.},

We aimed to determine whether endosymbionts are implicated in the thelytoky of V. canescens. After screening females of the two reproductive modes for several reproductive parasites: bacteria (Wolbachia, Rickettsia, Bacteroidetes, Spiroplasma, Arsenophonus) and Microsporidia, we concluded that thelytoky in V. canescens is not induced by any of these parasites and confirmed its suitability as a biological model for solving the evolutionary enigma of the maintenance of sexual reproduction.},

Female multiple mating (polyandry) has nevertheless evolved several times in the social Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), and a substantial amount of work has been conducted to understand its costs and benefits. Relatedness and inclusive fitness benefits are, however, not only influenced by queen mating frequency but also by paternity skew, which is a quantitative measure of paternity biases among the offspring of polyandrous females. We performed a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of paternity skew across polyandrous social Hymenoptera. We found a general and significant negative association between paternity frequency and paternity skew. High paternity skew, which increases relatedness among colony members and thus maximizes inclusive fitness gains, characterized species with low paternity frequency. However, species with highly polyandrous queens had low paternity skew, with paternity equalized among potential sires. Equal paternity shares among fathers are expected to maximize fitness benefits derived from genetic diversity among offspring. We discuss the potential for postcopulatory sexual selection to influence patterns of paternity in social insects, and suggest that sexual selection may have played a key, yet overlooked role in social evolution.},

We provide the first estimate of the global molecular phylogeny for the Sycoryctinae - a large subfamily of fig wasps consisting mainly of parasitoids of fig-pollinating wasps. We find strong support for a large Old World clade that contains eight of the eleven genera, in the tribes Sycoryctini and Philotrypesini. The sister taxon is tribe Apocryptini, comprising the genera Apocrypta and Bouceka. Finally, a new tribe, Critogastrini, is raised for the genus Critogaster, sister to all other sycoryctines. At the genus level, we found a general pattern of strong host conservatism, in which closely related wasps associate with closely related figs. Despite this, there is also evidence for multiple host shifts between more distantly related figs in some wasp genera (especially Philotrypesis). We estimate Sycoryctinae to have originated 49-64 Ma, after the initial co-radiation of the host figs and pollinators. Further, conservative assumptions in our analyses probably overestimate the age of the sycoryctines. Together, patterns of host association, evidence for a mix of host constraints and host shifting, and molecular dating suggest that sycoryctine parasites radiated through delayed phylogenetic tracking of their hosts. This contributes to the growing body of literature suggesting that coevolving parasites often radiate after their hosts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Despite their ecological significance as decomposers and their evolutionary significance as the most speciose eusocial insect group outside the Hymenoptera, termite (Blattodea: Termitoidae or Isoptera) evolutionary relationships have yet to be well resolved. Previous morphological and molecular analyses strongly conflict at the family level and are marked by poor support for backbone nodes. A mitochondrial (mt) genome phylogeny of termites was produced to test relationships between the recognised termite families, improve nodal support and test the phylogenetic utility of rare genomic changes found in the termite mt genome. Complete mt genomes were sequenced for 7 of the 9 extant termite families with additional representatives of each of the two most speciose families Rhinotermitidae (3 of 7 subfamilies) and Termitidae (3 of 8 subfamilies). The mt genome of the well supported sister-group of termites, the subsocial cockroach Cryptocercus, was also sequenced. A highly supported tree of termite relationships was produced by all analytical methods and data treatment approaches, however the relationship of the termites + Cryptocercus clade to other cockroach lineages was highly affected by the strong nucleotide compositional bias found in termites relative to other dictyopterans. The phylogeny supports previously proposed suprafamilial termite lineages, the Euisoptera and Neoisoptera, a later derived Kalotermitidae as sister group of the Neoisoptera and a monophyletic clade of dampwood (Stolotermitidae, Archotermopsidae) and harvester termites (Hodotermitidae). In contrast to previous termite phylogenetic studies, nodal supports were very high for family-level relationships within termites. Two rare genomic changes in the mt genome control region were found to be molecular synapomorphies for major clades. An elongated stem-loop structure defined the clade Polyphagidae + (Cryptocercus + termites), and a further series of compensatory base changes in this stem-loop is synapomorphic for the Neoisoptera. The complicated repeat structures first identified in Reticulitermes, composed of short (A-type) and long (B-type repeats) defines the clade Heterotermitinae + Termitidae, while the secondary loss of A-type repeats is synapomorphic for the non-macrotermitine Termitidae.

A phylogenetic analysis which included COI sequences of several species of Melipona Illiger, 1806 revealed that numts are also common among other species of the genus. Based on our results, we have proposed a checklist to help to identify the most conspicuous numts; however, it does not ensure that all numts will be identified, since not all numts present explicit signals.

The results indicate that Chaetacis nests within Micrathena and we propose Chaetacis as a junior synonym of Micrathena. Twelve subgeneric species groups of Micrathena are recognized and diagnosed. Species with extremely long spines evolved at least eight times in the genus and we suggest that this may be related to antipredator defences. Micrathena is primitively sexually monomorphic and extreme sexual size dimorphism has arisen at least six times in the genus. Most of these events are because of enlargement of the female in relation to the ancestral size, although in two cases sexual dimorphism was attained through male reduction, adding more data to the `giant females' vs. `dwarf males' controversy. The genus is probably of South American origin and has repeatedly invaded Central and North America.

	abstract = {The habit of mining within leaves has evolved convergently in numerous plant-feeding insect taxa. Many leaf-mining groups contain a large number of species with distinct feeding preferences, which makes them highly suitable for studies on the evolutionary history of host-plant use and on the role of niche shifts in speciation. We aimed to clarify the origin, classification, and ecological evolution of the tenthredinid sawfly subfamily Heterarthrinae, which contains c. 150 leaf-mining species that collectively feed on over 20 plant genera around the world. For this, we reconstructed the phylogeny of representative heterarthrine species and diverse outgroups from the superfamily Tenthredinoidea on the basis of DNA sequence data collected from two mitochondrial (Col and Cytb) and two nuclear (EF-1 alpha and NaK) genes. Thereafter, we inferred the history of niche diversification within Heterarthrinae by plotting larval host-plant associations on the trees, and by contrasting a time-calibrated leaf-miner phylogeny with the phylogeny of their host plants. The results show that: (1) heterarthrine leaf-miners constitute a monophyletic group that arose from external-feeding blennocampine lineages within the Tenthredinidae c. 110-80 million years ago; (2) heterarthrines generally radiated well after their host taxa, and extant host-plant associations therefore result from a combination of host conservatism and occasional shifts among available plant taxa; and (3) diversification in Heterarthrinae apparently occurs by multiple mechanisms, including sympatric or allopatric ecological speciation, non-ecological allopatric speciation, and possibly allochronic speciation. Overall, both present and historical host-use patterns within the Heterarthrinae exhibit striking similarities to patterns found in co-occurring herbivore taxa. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Of approximately 84 currently recognized Ichneumonoidea subfamilies, 2500 genera and 41 000 described species, barcoding 5'-COI data were assembled for 4168 putative species-level terminals (many undescribed), representing 671 genera and all but ten of the currently recognized subfamilies. After the removal of identical and near-identical sequences, the 4174 initial sequences were reduced to 3278. We show that when subjected to phylogenetic analysis using both maximum likelihood and parsimony, there is a broad correlation between taxonomic congruence and number of included sequences. We additionally present a new measure of taxonomic congruence based upon the Simpson diversity index, the Simpson dominance index, which gives greater weight to morphologically recognized taxonomic groups (subfamilies) recovered with most representatives in one or a few contiguous groups or subclusters.},

	abstract = {Bumble bees (Bombus Latreille) are an important group of social insects, well recognized throughout northern temperate regions as important pollinators of wild and agricultural plants. Little is known about the biology of this group in southern portions of the Americas, especially in Mesoamerica, a region of geological and ecological complexity from Mexico through Central America. One ubiquitous Mesoamerican species, Bombus ephippiatus, is enigmatic. Like many other Bombus, this species is homogeneous in body structure yet exhibits striking intraspecific color pattern polymorphism across its range, leading to uncertainty about its genealogical boundaries. It has been grouped taxonomically with B. wilmattae, a species narrowly restricted to southern Mexico and northern Guatamala. Furthermore, the relationships between these two taxa and a third species, B. impatiens, found only in America north of Mexico, have been controversial. Our phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from mitochondrial COI and nuclear PEPCK and CAD resolves the phylogeny of these three taxa as (B. impatiens, (B. ephippiatus, B. wilmattae)). Additional data from eight nuclear microsatellite markers reveal complex patterns of genetic divergence and isolation among populations of B. ephippiatus across its extensive geographic range, providing evidence for multiple independent evolutionary lineages. These lineages correspond not only to geographic and habitat variation across their range, but also to distinct color pattern groups present in the species. Knowledge of the phylogeny and genetic divergence of the B. ephippiatus group will provide a framework for understanding evolutionary and ecological origins of color pattern polymorphism in bumble bees, as well as providing insight into geographical factors enhancing speciation in Mesoamerica.

The polymorphisms were subsequently confirmed by direct DNA sequencing with sequences thereafter deposited in Genbank. In this study, six novel composite genotypes (haplotypes) were found in Turkish honey bee populations. The most common haplotype, type 1, was found in 12 of the sampled populations and overall accounted for 85.5\% of the samples. TCS spanning network of haplotypes revealed that type 1 was the basal haplotype. Genetic distance (D) values were found to be low (0.0-0.0112) within Turkish honey bee populations.

The view that T. tajimaense is closely related to T. semblidis, another parasitoid of Sialis eggs, is supported by the results of a phylogenetic analysis, as well as by the biological and morphological similarities between both species. Trichogramma tajimaense is also similar in male wing polymorphism to T. kurosuae, a gregarious egg parasitoid of the lepidopteran Ivela auripes, as both Trichogramma species exhibit male wing trimorphism (fully alate, brachypterous and apterous forms) in contrast to the male wing dimorphism (fully alate and apterous forms) of T. semblidis. However, no phylogenetic analysis reveals a close relationship between T. tajimaense and T. kurosuae, and a difference exists between these two species in the mean percentage of flightless (brachypterous and apterous) males that emerge from a host egg mass; 96\% of T. tajimaense males are incapable of flight, whereas about 50\% of T. kurosuae males are flightless. Because all or almost all males of T. semblidis parasitizing Sialis eggs are apterous, T. tajimaense is more similar to T. semblidis than to T. kurosuae in the proportion of flightless males. In addition, male wing polymorphisms of Trichogramma in relation to mating systems could also show a similarity between T. tajimaense and T. semblidis when considering both species as quasi-gregarious parasitoids of Sialis eggs.},

Honey bees and bumble bees appear to have a simple intestinal bacterial fauna that includes acidophilic bacteria. Here, we explore the hypothesis that sweat bees can acquire acidophilic bacteria from the environment. To quantify bacterial communities associated with two species of North American and one species of Neotropical sweat bees, we conducted 16S rDNA amplicon 454 pyrosequencing of bacteria associated with the bees, their brood cells and their nests. Lactobacillus spp. were the most abundant bacteria in many, but not all, of the samples. To determine whether bee-associated lactobacilli can also be found in the environment, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Lactobacillus. Previously described groups that associate with Bombus and Apis appeared relatively specific to these genera. Close relatives of several bacteria that have been isolated from flowers, however, were isolated from bees. Additionally, all three sweat bee species associated with lactobacilli related to flower-associated lactobacilli. These data suggest that there may be at least two different means by which bees acquire putative probiotics. Some lactobacilli appear specific to corbiculate apids, possibly because they are largely maternally inherited (vertically transmitted). Other lactobacilli, however, may be regularly acquired from environmental sources such as flowers. Sweat beeassociated lactobacilli were found to be abundant in the pollen and frass inside the nests of halictids, suggesting that they could play a role in suppressing the growth of moulds and other spoilage organisms.},

Our results suggest Figitidae, as currently defined, is not monophyletic. Furthermore, Mikeiinae and Pycnostigminae are sister-groups, nested adjacent to Thrasorinae, Plectocynipinae and Euceroptrinae. The recovery of Pycnostigminae as sister-group to Mikeiinae suggests two major patterns of evolution: (i) early Figitidae lineages demonstrate a Gondawanan origin (Plectocynipinae: Neotropical; Mikeiinae and Thrasorinae: Australia; Pycnostigminae: Africa); and (ii) based on host records for Mikeiinae, Thrasorinae and Plectocynipinae, Pycnostigminae are predicted to be parasitic on gall-inducing Hymenoptera. The phylogenetic position of Parnips (Parnipinae) was unstable, and various analyses were conducted to determine the impact of this uncertainty on both the recovery of other clades and inferred divergence times; when Parnips was excluded from the total evidence analysis, Cynipidae was found to be sister-group to [Euceroptrinae + (Plectocynipinae (Thrasorinae + (Mikeiinae + Pycnostigminae)))], with low support. Divergence dating analyses using BEAST indicate the stem-group node of Figitidae to be c. 126 Ma; the dipteran parasitoids (Eucoilinae and Figitinae), were estimated to have a median age of 80 and 88 Ma, respectively; the neuropteran parasitoids (Anacharitinae), were estimated to have a median age of 97 Ma; sternorrhynchan hyperparasitoids (Charipinae), were estimated to have a median age of 110 Ma; the Hymenoptera-parasitic subfamilies (Euceroptinae, Plectocynipinae, Trasorinae, Mikeiinae, Pycnostigminae, and Parnipinae), ranged in median ages from 48 to 108 Ma. Rapid radiation of Eucoilinae subclades appears chronologically synchronized with the origin of their hosts, Schizophora (Diptera). Overall, the exclusion of Parnips from the BEAST analysis did not result in significant changes to divergence estimates. Finally, though sparsely represented in the analysis, our data suggest Cynipidae have a median age of 54 Ma, which is somewhat older than the age of Quercus spp (3050 Ma), their most common host.},

A combined morphological and molecular phylogenetic approach was used to test for monophyly of North American socially parasitic Dialictus. Two data sets were used in the phylogenetic analyses. First, short mitochondrial DNA sequences from previous taxonomic studies of North American Dialictus, including six social parasites, were used because of the broad taxon sampling they provide. These data were analysed in combination with a set of 40 morphological characters, including a large proportion of characters associated with social parasitism. Phylogenetic analysis of the combined DNA barcode and morphology data set resolves two distinct lineages of social parasite. The second data set was based on three genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, elongation factor 1a, and long-wavelength rhodopsin), but with sparser taxon sampling, including one representative from each putative social parasite-lineage. This also supported dual origins of social parasitism among North American Dialictus. The evolution of social parasitism is discussed.},

In this study, we surveyed the genetic variation of mitochondrial DNA sequences in Apis species from China and investigated the phylogeography of Apis dorsata F. in China and neighboring Asian areas. The phylogeny of Chinese Apis species was consistent with the generally accepted Apis phylogeny, and a substructure within A. dorsata was suggested. Furthermore, results of analysis of molecular variance revealed significant genetic structuring of A. dorsata between Hainan Island and China mainland. When compared with neighboring Asian areas, Chinese A. dorsata grouped with one A. dorsata sample from Palawan Island of Philippines and two samples from Malaysia. Another two samples from Malaysia clustered with one Nepalese sample and the cluster from Thailand also was supported. These results support the hypothesis that glaciations and deglaciations during the Pleistocene could have greatly influenced the distribution and divergence of A. dorsata in China and Southeast Asia. In addition, the species status of Apis dorsata breviligula Maa and Apis dorsata binghami Cockerell were supported in our study and genetic variation may exist in Apis laboriosa Smith despite of limited natural distribution.},

	abstract = {Although several bee venom serine protease genes have been previously described, fibrin(ogen)olytic activity of these serine proteases has been reported for only two bumblebees to date, Bombus ignitus and B. terrestris. Here, we cloned venom serine proteases from the other bumblebee species, B. hypocrita sapporoensis and B. ardens ardens. The venom serine protease genes of B. h. sapporoensis and B. a. ardens consist of 358 amino acids and 357 amino acids, respectively. We compared the predicted mature protein sequences of these serine protease genes to those previously reported for other bees. A phylogenetic analysis shows that B. h. sapporoensis venom serine protease is further immediately close to B. ignitus and B. terrestris venom serine proteases, excluding the venom serine protease of B. a. ardens. Using B. h. sapporoensis venom serine protease (Bs-VSP), we identified that Bs-VSP acts as a fibrin(ogen)olytic enzyme. We also found that Bs-VSP activates prothrombin and directly degrades fibrinogen into fibrin degradation products. Our results further define roles for bumblebee venom serine proteases as fibrin(ogen)olytic agents.

We first identified species on a morphological basis and then assessed the consistency of genetic and morphological data. Probably because of mitochondrial introgression, Aphidius ervi and A.microlophii were indistinguishable on the basis of their COI sequences, whereas LWRh sequences discriminated these species. Conversely, because of its lower variability, LWRh failed to discriminate two pairs of species (Aphidius aquilus, Aphidius salicis, Lysiphlebus confusus and Lysiphlebus fabarum). Our study showed that no unique locus but a combination of two genes should be used to accurately identify members of Aphidiinae.},

	abstract = {Mobile elements are widely present in eukaryotic genomes. They are repeated DNA segments that are able to move from one locus to another within the genome. They are divided into two main categories, depending on their mechanism of transposition, involving RNA (class I) or DNA (class II) molecules. The mariner-like elements are class II transposons. They encode their own transposase, which is necessary and sufficient for transposition in the absence of host factors. They are flanked by a short inverted terminal repeat and a TA dinucleotide target site, which is duplicated upon insertion. The transposase consists of two domains, an N-terminal inverted terminal repeat binding domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. We identified a transposable element with molecular characteristics of a mariner-like element in Atta sexdens rubropilosa genome. Identification started from a PCR with degenerate primers and queen genomic DNA templates, with which it was possible to amplify a fragment with mariner transposable-element homology. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this element belongs to the mauritiana subfamily of mariner-like elements and it was named Asmar1. We found that Asmar1 is homologous to a transposon described from another ant, Messor bouvieri. The predicted transposase sequence demonstrated that Asmar1 has a truncated transposase ORF. This study is part of a molecular characterization of mobile elements in the Atta spp genome. Our finding of mariner-like elements in all castes of this ant could be useful to help understand the dynamics of mariner-like element distribution in the Hymenoptera.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-11-348},
	abstract = {Background: The Lysiphlebus fabarum group is a taxonomically poorly resolved complex of aphid parasitoids, presently split into three described species that comprise sexual (arrhenotokous) and asexual (thelytokous) lineages of unknown relationship. Specifically, it is unclear how asexuals evolved from sexuals in this system, to what extent reproductive modes are still connected by genetic exchange, how much the complex is structured by geography or by host-associated differentiation, and whether species designations are valid. Using a combination of population genetic and phylogenetic approaches, we addressed these issues in a comprehensive sample of parasitoid wasps from across Europe. Results: Asexual reproduction predominated in parasitoids of the L. fabarum group, with asexual populations exhibiting high genotypic diversity. Sexual populations were only common in southern France; elsewhere sexual reproduction was restricted to specific aphid hosts. Although reproductive modes were aggregated on the mitochondrial genealogy and significantly differentiated at nuclear microsatellite loci, there was clear evidence for genetic exchange, especially on hosts attacked by sexual and asexual parasitoids. The microsatellite data further revealed that parasitoids collected from certain host aphids were significantly differentiated, yet the mitochondrial sequence variation across the entire L. fabarum group did not exceed 1.32\% and exhibited a very shallow topology. Morphological characters used for delineation of described species were found to be phylogenetically non-conservative. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the sexual-asexual L. fabarum group represents a young complex of lineages with incomplete isolation between reproductive modes. We propose three mechanisms of genetic exchange that may jointly explain the high genotypic diversity observed in asexual parasitoids: (i) the formation of new asexual lineages via `contagious parthenogenesis', (ii) introgression from sexual lineages through matings between sexual males and thelytokous females, and (iii) `cryptic sex' within asexuals, mediated by rare males that thelytokous lines are known to produce spontaneously. The partially strong differentiation among wasps collected from different aphids suggests that host specialization can evolve readily in these parasitoids. Finally, we conclude that in the light of our data, the current taxonomic division of the L. fabarum group into three species cannot be upheld.},

Eulophidae was strongly supported as monophyletic only after exclusion of the enigmatic genus Trisecodes. The subfamilies Eulophinae, Entiinae (=Euderinae) and Tetrastichinae were consistently supported as monophyletic, but Entedoninae was monophyletic only in combined analyses.

	abstract = {The tribe Meteorini includes two genera, Meteorus and Zele, which are koinobiont endoparasitoids of larval Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. More than 300 species are known, about one fifth of which occur in the Western Palearctic. Here, we revise the Western Palearctic species, based partly on traditional approaches and partly on molecular analysis of recent Swedish and Finnish material. For the analyses of phylogenetic relationships and cryptic species diversity, we coded 17 morphological characters and sequenced two markers, 28S D2 (649 bp) and CO1 (665 bp). More than 1 970 specimens representing 54 species of Meteorus Haliday and 5 species of Zele Curtis were studied; of these, 177 specimens representing 41 species were sequenced. Seven new species are described, all from the Fennoscandian material: Meteorus artocercus sp. nov., M. densipilosus sp. nov., M. eklundi sp. nov., M. longipilosus sp. nov., M. sibyllae sp. nov., M. stenomastax sp. nov., and M. subtilisulcus sp. nov. Four new synonyms are introduced: Z. chlorophthalmus (Spinola 1808), syn. nov. for M. pallidus (Nees 1812), M. punctifrons Thomson 1895, syn. nov. for M. varinervis (Tobias 1986), M. melanostictus Capron 1887, syn. nov for M. monachae (Tobias 1986), and M. tenellus Marshall 1887, syn. nov. for M. boreus (Tobias 1986). Meteorus tenellus is removed from synonymy with M. cinctellus.

	abstract = {In attempting to explain the marked interspecific variation evident in many components of life-history in parasitoid wasps, biologists have sought to identify general predictors of suites of `important' life-history traits. Two predictors currently in general use are: (1) the parasitoid mode of larval development in relation to future host growth and development [no further host growth and development ( = idiobiosis) versus continued host growth and development ( = koinobiosis)]; and (2) the ovigeny index (the degree to which the lifetime potential complement of eggs is mature at the start of adult life in females). These have been postulated to share several life-history correlates, and an earlier comparative analysis showed the predictors to be associated. Two questions are thus posed: which life-history variables are actually common to both idio/koinobiosis and the ovigeny index, and which are responsible for the link between these two axes of life-history diversity? Through comparative analyses of a database of life-history traits for 133 parasitoid wasp species, four life-history correlates out of the 11 we investigated are shown to account for the association between the two predictors: the relative level of resource investment per egg (degree of yolk richness, which is lower in koinobionts), pre-adult lifespan (longer in koinobionts), female lifespan (shorter in koinobionts), and maximum egg load (larger in koinobionts). Our findings pave the way for full integration of the dichotomous hypothesis with the ovigeny index hypothesis, to provide a holistic perspective on parasitoid wasp life-history diversity and evolution.

Parasitoid wasps are among the most species rich and at the same time most understudied of all metazoan taxa. To understand their diversification and test hypotheses about their evolution, we need robust phylogenetic hypotheses. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny of the subfamily Diplazontinae using four genes and 66 morphological characters both in separate analyses and in a total evidence approach. The resulting phylogeny is highly resolved, with most clades supported by multiple independent data partitions. It contains three highly supported genus groups, for which we suggest morphological and behavioural synapomorphies. The placement of some of the genera, especially Xestopelta Dasch, is unexpected, but also supported by morphology. Most of the genera are retrieved as monophyletic, with the exception of the morphologically diverse genus Syrphoctonus Forster. We split this genus into three genera, including Fossatyloides gen. n., to restore the phylogeny-classification link. Conflict between the morphological and the molecular topology was mostly resolved in favour of the molecular partition in the total evidence approach. We discuss reasons for this finding, and suggest strategies for future taxon and character sampling in Diplazontinae.},

Integrative taxonomy aims to define stronger supported taxonomic hypotheses by considering complementary datasets from different characters. By following an integrative approach, the present study includes molecular, chemical and morphological criteria to establish the taxonomic status of two rare and doubtful cuckoo bumblebee taxa: Bombus (Psithyrus) barbutellus and Bombus (Psithyrus) maxillosus. These two sympatric taxa are discriminated by few morphological criteria (mainly wing darkness and hair length). We used these morphological character diagnoses to establish an a priori status of our samples (23 specimens). We developed a combined molecular dataset from one nuclear gene, elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), and one mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), spanning 1623 bp, and a chemical dataset of sexual marking pheromones (73 compounds). The molecular data were subjected to maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference under partitioned model and maximum parsimony. The chemical data were analysed by clustering and the two-group k-means method to test divergences between the two species. The resulting phylogenetic trees show no consistent divergence between the two taxa. Moreover, we found no divergence in the sexual marking pheromones in the clustering and two-group k-means analyses. These converging results support the conspecificity of both taxa. Nonetheless, our determinations using the traditional morphological criteria separated our samples into two taxa. We conclude that the morphological criteria seem to relate to intraspecific variations: B. maxillosus is regarded as a syn.n. of B. barbutellus.},

Although the two suborders Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata within the Decapoda are widely accepted, this taxonomic view is now challenged when using mitochondrial protein-coding genes to investigate the decapod phylogeny, especially for the basal pleocyematan groups. Here, we enhanced taxonomic coverage by sequencing the genomes of two basal decapod taxa Alpheus distinguendus and Panulirus ornatus, representing two infraorders, Caridea and Achelata, respectively. Based on these two and other available mitochondrial genomes, we evaluated the usefulness of protein-coding genes in resolving deep phylogenetic relationships of the Decapoda using maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. The mt genomic results revealed a novel gene order because of the reverse transposition of trnE (transfer, trn for Glutamate) and a pseudogene-like trnS (AGN) [trn for Serine (S-1, AGN)] in the mitochondrial genome of A. distinguendus, and a duplicate of 89 bp sequences in the putative noncoding region of P. ornatus. Our phylogenetic inferences suggest monophyly of the Decapoda and its two suborders, and that several lineages within the Reptantia are consistently recovered with high nodal supports. Our findings suggest that the best mitochondrial genome phylogeny can be found on the premise that systematic errors should be minimized as much as possible.

	abstract = {The ignita species group within the genus Chrysis includes over 100 cuckoo wasp species, which all lead a parasitic lifestyle and exhibit very similar morphology. The lack of robust, diagnostic morphological characters has hindered phylogenetic reconstructions and contributed to frequent misidentification and inconsistent interpretations of species in this group. Therefore, molecular phylogenetic analysis is the most suitable approach for resolving the phylogeny and taxonomy of this group. We present a well-resolved phylogeny of the Chrysis ignita species group based on mitochondrial sequence data. from 41 ingroup and six outgroup taxa. Although our emphasis was on European taxa, we included samples from most of the distribution range of the C ignita species group to test for monophyly. We used a continuous mitochondrial DNA sequence consisting of 16S rRNA, tRNA(Val), 12S rRNA and ND4. The location of the ND4 gene at the 3' end of this continuous sequence, following 12S rRNA, represents a novel mitochondrial gene arrangement for insects. Due to difficulties in aligning rRNA genes, two different Bayesian approaches were employed to reconstruct phylogeny: (1) using a reduced data matrix including only those positions that could be aligned with confidence; or (2) using the full sequence dataset while estimating alignment and phylogeny simultaneously. In addition maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses were performed to test the robustness of the Bayesian approaches. Although all approaches yielded trees with similar topology, considerably more nodes were resolved with analyses using the full data matrix. Phylogenetic analysis supported the monophyly of the C ignita species group and divided its species into well-supported clades. The resultant phylogeny was only partly in accordance with published subgroupings based on morphology. Our results suggest that several taxa currently treated as subspecies or names treated as synonyms may in fact constitute separate species. Our study provides a solid basis for further systematic investigations of this enigmatic insect group. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, a comprehensive study was carried out to review the taxonomy of the genus Paratetrapedia and to investigate cladistically the relationships amongst its species. Eighteen new species of Paratetrapedia are described, giving a total of 32 species in the genus. A phylogenetic analysis of the species of Paratetrapedia was carried out using 61 morphological characters for 41 terminal taxa. The phylogenetic results confirmed the monophyly of Paratetrapedia and allowed the recognition of five species groups: the lugubris, moesta, bicolor, lineata, and flavipennis groups. Nasutopedia gen. nov., recognized as the sister group of Paratetrapedia and with its distribution restricted to the western forested portions of the Andean highlands, is proposed based on distinct morphology, its placement in the phylogenetic tree, and biogeographical patterns. Species of Paratetrapedia are especially diverse in the Amazon Forest; the eastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest contains four endemic species, and one species is endemic to the Cerrado of central Brazil. Paratetrapedia shows a biogeographical pattern similar to other Neotropical groups of bees and birds, with wide distribution and high diversity in lowland forests and whose sister taxon occurs on highlands of north- western portions of the Andean cordillera. Identification keys for males and females of all species are provided, as well as distribution maps and illustrations of general external morphology and genitalia.

The systematics within the genus has gained little attention and this is a first attempt to shed some light over the systematics of Boletina and to test the segregation of the genera Saigusaia and Aglaomyia from Boletina. The nuclear marker 28S and mitochondrial 16S, COI and CytB were amplified and sequenced for 23 taxa that were analysed separately and together with a broad sample of outgroup taxa obtained from GenBank, where also 18S sequences were added. Phylogenies were estimated using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and parsimony. We strengthen the hypothesized sister-group relationship between Docosia and Boletina, but the genus Boletina as currently delimited appears to be paraphyletic and nested in a clade together with Aglaomyia, Coelosia and Gnoriste. The genus Saigusaia, on the other hand, seems to be well separated from Boletina. The Boletina erythropyga species group is consistently found as a distinct basal clade within Boletina s.l. The results obtained are otherwise ambiguous both for the taxa in focus and in some analyses globally with a statistically supported total breakdown of the traditional higher classification into tribes, subfamilies and even families. Interestingly, this breakdown almost disappeared when additional 18S sequences were added.},

Sexual deception is possible because chemical rather than visual cues play the key role in wasp mate search, suggesting that cryptic wasp species may be frequent. We investigated this prospect among Neozeleboria wasp pollinators of Chiloglottis orchids, drawing on evidence from molecular phylogenetic analysis at three genes (CO1, rhodopsin and wingless), population genetic and statistical parsimony analysis at CO1, orchid associations and their semiochemicals, and geographic ranges. We found a compelling relationship between genetically defined wasp groups, orchid associations, semiochemicals and geographic range, despite a frequent lack of detectable morphological differences. Our findings reveal multiple cryptic species among orchid pollinators and indicate that chemical changes are important for wasp reproductive isolation and speciation. The diversity of Neozeleboria may have enabled, rather than constrained, pollinator-driven speciation in these orchids. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The rare condition of heterotrophic heteronomy, in which the sexes utilize disparate host taxa, is a poorly understood complex parasitic lifestyle. One of only two known examples occurs in the Myrmecolacidae, an unusual family of the parasitoid order Strepsiptera (Insecta), in which males parasitize ants while females parasitize grasshoppers, crickets, and praying mantids. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary pattern and timescale of host-use in a set of morphologically cryptic myrmecolacid taxa currently identified as Caenocholax fenyesi. We find that (i) C. fenyesi contains at least ten cryptic lineages consistent with separate species; (ii) Fossil evidence suggests a very low molecular clock rate and an ancient origin for cryptic lineages; (iii) Diversity among Caenocholax species is partitioned by geography and host association of the female; and (iv) Switches in host usage are uncoupled between the sexes, with changes in female host preference accompanying diversification. This study represents the first phylogeographical analysis of any strepsipteran, and the first molecular examination of host-use for a heterotrophic heteronomous taxon. Our results have implications for the understanding of evolution, host usage and estimated species richness in parasitic taxa.},

	abstract = {The parasitoid, Diadegma semiclausum (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) is one of the most effective parasitoids of diamondback moth (DBM) in the highlands ({\textgreater}1600 m above sea level) of Asia. A Diadegma population from the lowland areas of Horns, Syria (about 203-487 m above sea level) was examined to determine if it differs at the species-level from the D. semiclausum and other Diadegma populations present in different countries using molecular diagnostic tools. Phylogenetic analysis based on the neighbor-joining method using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences grouped the Horns (Syria) Diadegma population with D. semiclausum populations from other countries. The results suggest that D. semiclausum occurs in the lowland conditions in Homs (Syria), where the temperature is higher. The Homs (Syria) strain did not show any variations in the parasitism when the parasitized host (DBM) larvae were exposed to varying temperatures for 24 h. It could not survive when the parasitized DBM larvae were continuously reared at 35 degrees C; however it inflicted significantly higher parasitism when the parasitized DBM larvae were reared at day and night temperatures of 35 degrees C and 20 degrees C, respectively. Preliminary results indicate that the D. semiclausum strain from Horns (Syria) possesses some level of heat tolerance, which could be exploited for successful management of DBM in the tropical lowlands.

	abstract = {The Son-killer bacterium, Arsenophonus nasoniae, infects Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), a parasitic wasp that attacks filth flies. This gammaproteobacterium kills a substantial amount of male embryos produced by an infected female. Aside from male death, the bacterium does not measurably affect the host, and how it is maintained in the host population is unknown. Interestingly, this bacterial symbiont can be transmitted both vertically (from mother to offspring) and horizontally (to unrelated Nasonia wasps developing in the same fly host). This latter mode may allow the bacterium to spread throughout the ecological community of filth flies and their parasitoids, and to colonize novel species, as well as permit its long-term persistence. We tested 11 species of filth flies and 25 species of their associated parasitoids (representing 28 populations from 16 countries) using diagnostic PCR to assess the bacterium's actual host range. In addition to 16S rRNA, two loci were targeted: the housekeeping gene infB, and a sequence with high homology to a DNA polymerase gene from a lysogenic phage previously identified from other insect symbionts. We identified infections of A. nasoniae in four species of parasitoids, representing three taxonomic families. Highly similar phage sequences were also identified in three of the four species. These results identify the symbiont as a generalist, rather than a specialist restricted solely to species of Nasonia, and also that horizontal transmission may play an important role in its maintenance.

	abstract = {Australia's monsoonal tropics are dominated by the largest and least modified savanna woodlands in the world, and they are globally significant for their high biodiversity and regional endemism. Despite this, there have been very few molecular studies of the evolutionary origins and diversification of vertebrates in this region. The semi-arboreal dragon lizards of Lophognathus and Amphibolurus are widely distributed in the savanna and dry sclerophyll woodlands of Australasia, including the monsoon tropics. We sequenced a similar to 1400 bp region of mitochondrial DNA and a similar to 1400 bp nuclear gene (RAG1) to investigate the phylogenetic relationships and phylogeographic structuring of all seven species of Lophognathus and Amphibolurus. Our analyses show that there is a higher level of species and generic diversity in the monsoon tropics than previously thought, and a full morphological review and taxonomic revision of these genera is required. Relaxed molecular clock analyses indicate that species across both genera originated in the late Miocene and early Pliocene, with significant phylogeographic structure within species. We did not find any evidence that the monsoon tropics species were a monophyletic group that had diversified within the region; instead Amphibolurus and Lophognathus represent at least three independent evolutionary colonizations of the monsoon tropics. It is probable that the origins and phylogeographic patterns of the northern Lophognathus species have evolved under the climatic influence of the Australian monsoon, rather than being either an ancient Gondwanan lineage that pre-dates the monsoon or the result of a more recent dispersal event across Wallace's Line.

The evolution of some of the characters is explored by mapping them on a recently published phylogeny of Hymenoptera. Based on this phylogeny, it is reasonable to assume that wood-living wasps evolved from a xylophagous/mycetophagous stage as displayed by woodwasps to a carnivorous/parasitoid lifestyle, preying on woodboring insect larvae. The latter mode of life is probably ancestral to the Apocrita which comprise the majority of the order; they share this lifestyle with their sister group, the Orussidae. However, most apocritan wasps have radiated into other habitats, the Orussidae and Stephanidae apparently being the only taxa that have retained the ancestral lifestyle of carnivorous wasps. Other apocritan lineages associated with wood (e.g., Aulacidae, Megalyridae, basal Cynipoidea and some Ichneumonoidea and Chalcidoidea) possibly entered this habitat secondarily and independently acquired morphological traits associated with it. The woody habitat was occupied by Hymenoptera during a crucial stage in their evolution where the transition from the phytophagous to carnivorous lifestyle took place. The anatomy of both larva and adults was extensively transformed in the process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Parasitic wasps constitute one of the largest group of venomous animals. Although some physiological effects of their venoms are well documented, relatively little is known at the molecular level on the protein composition of these secretions. To identify the majority of the venom proteins of the endoparasitoid wasp Chelonus inanitus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), we have randomly sequenced 2111 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a cDNA library of venom gland. In parallel, proteins from pure venom were separated by gel electrophoresis and individually submitted to a nano-LC-MS/MS analysis allowing comparison of peptides and ESTs sequences. Results: About 60\% of sequenced ESTs encoded proteins whose presence in venom was attested by mass spectrometry. Most of the remaining ESTs corresponded to gene products likely involved in the transcriptional and translational machinery of venom gland cells. In addition, a small number of transcripts were found to encode proteins that share sequence similarity with well-known venom constituents of social hymenopteran species, such as hyaluronidase-like proteins and an Allergen-5 protein. An overall number of 29 venom proteins could be identified through the combination of ESTs sequencing and proteomic analyses. The most highly redundant set of ESTs encoded a protein that shared sequence similarity with a venom protein of unknown function potentially specific of the Chelonus lineage. Venom components specific to C. inanitus included a C-type lectin domain containing protein, a chemosensory protein-like protein, a protein related to yellow-e3 and ten new proteins which shared no significant sequence similarity with known sequences. In addition, several venom proteins potentially able to interact with chitin were also identified including a chitinase, an imaginal disc growth factor-like protein and two putative mucin-like peritrophins. Conclusions: The use of the combined approaches has allowed to discriminate between cellular and truly venom proteins. The venom of C. inanitus appears as a mixture of conserved venom components and of potentially lineage-specific proteins. These new molecular data enrich our knowledge on parasitoid venoms and more generally, might contribute to a better understanding of the evolution and functional diversity of venom proteins within Hymenoptera.},

A phylogenetic analysis using 22 morphological characters,12 extinct pelecinid taxa and one extant pelecinid taxon at the generic level suggests that Megapelecinus gen. nov. is the most basal pelecinid, whereas Cathaypelecinus Shih, Liu et Ren 2009, Archaeopelecinus Shih, Liu et Ren 2009, and Iscopinus Kozlov, 1974 forming a basal clade. Natural selection is demonstrated in pelecinids by the preference of larger female body size offering potentially better ovipositing capability and more efficient forewing venation with an X pattern providing potentially stronger wing structure and better flight performance for large-sized pelecinids. Furthermore, temporal and spatial analyses indicate that the most parsimonious hypothesis is that pelecinid might have originated from Northeastern China, spread to Central and Eastern Asia, and then dispersed to Americas.},

This study investigates the contribution of geographic modes of speciation such as dispersal, vicariance, and isolation by distance. We sampled haplotypes of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I from Ceratosolen pollinators of six geographically widespread Australasian fig (Moraceae: Ficus) species, including four species spanning Wallacea. Phylogenetic analysis investigated the extent of host conservatism and host switching accompanying divergence in Ceratosolen Geographically widespread Ceratosolen showed deep intraspecific divergence exceeding or comparable to divergence between named sister species. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses supported species monophyly in five of six cases, whereas results for a sixth species were equivocal. Bayesian divergence time estimation suggested dispersal across Wallacea during the Miocene epoch, after the collision of Australian and Asian continental plates. Cryptic species were evident in all six focal taxa. Because the deep mitochondrial divergence within these taxa is regionally distributed, allopatric divergence provides a simple explanation for the existence of these cryptic lineages pollinating widespread fig species. We found little evidence of divergence accompanied by host switching. The ancient origin of cryptic and geographically isolated species suggests that long-distance dispersal may be rare in Ceratosolen and that host associations are generally conserved during range expansion.},

	abstract = {Understanding the history of diversification in the North American deserts has long been a goal of biogeographers and evolutionary biologists. Although it appears that a consensus is forming regarding the patterns of diversification in the Nearctic deserts in vertebrate taxa, little work has been done exploring the historical biogeography of widespread invertebrate taxa. Before a robust model of geobiotic change in the North American deserts can be proposed, it needs to be determined whether the same historical events affected vertebrate and invertebrate taxa in the same way. We explore the phylogeographic patterns in a widespread nocturnal wasp genus Dilophotopsis using two rDNA loci, the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2). We use Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and haplotype network analysis to determine whether a consistent geographic pattern exists among species and populations within Dilophotopsis. We also used molecular dating techniques to estimate divergence dates of the major phylogenetic clades. Our analyses indicates that the species-level divergences in Dilophotopsis occurred in the Neogene, and likely were driven by mountain building during the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (approximately 5 Mya) similar to the divergences in many vertebrate taxa. The population-level divergences within species occurred during the Pleistocene (0.1-1.8 Mya). The present study shows that similar patterns of diversification exist in vertebrate and invertebrate taxa.

Both maximum-parsimony analyses and Bayesian inference were employed to analyse two datasets consisting of combined morphological and molecular data, one aligned using progressive alignment methods and the second aligned by secondary structure models. Rhinocricidae was recovered sister to all remaining spirobolidan millipedes and is elevated to suborder status as suborder Rhinocricidea. Trigoniulidea was recovered as monophyletic as was Spirobolidea excluding Rhinocricidae; Spirobolidea is redefined to reflect this change. All previously recognized families were recovered, with the exception of Spirobolidae; in all instances, this family was paraphyletic or part of a polytomy that lacked sufficient resolution to assess its monophyly.

Analytical results are unstable because some of the fossil taxa have many missing entries. The most stable results are produced when the maimetshid taxa and Cretodinapsis are excluded.

The divergence time of these two phylogroups was estimated between 0.233 and 0.840 million years ago in the Pleistocene, a period of climatic changes and geomorphological alterations in the Neotropical region.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-10-266},
	abstract = {Background: Ecological speciation is a process in which a transiently resource-polymorphic species divides into two specialized sister lineages as a result of divergent selection pressures caused by the use of multiple niches or environments. Ecology-based speciation has been studied intensively in plant-feeding insects, in which both sympatric and allopatric shifts onto novel host plants could speed up diversification. However, while numerous examples of species pairs likely to have originated by resource shifts have been found, the overall importance of ecological speciation in relation to other, non-ecological speciation modes remains unknown. Here, we apply phylogenetic information on sawflies belonging to the `Higher' Nematinae (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) to infer the frequency of niche shifts in relation to speciation events. Results: Phylogenetic trees reconstructed on the basis of DNA sequence data show that the diversification of higher nematines has involved frequent shifts in larval feeding habits and in the use of plant taxa. However, the inferred number of resource shifts is considerably lower than the number of past speciation events, indicating that the majority of divergences have occurred by non-ecological allopatric speciation; based on a time-corrected analysis of sister species, we estimate that a maximum of c. 20\% of lineage splits have been triggered by a change in resource use. In addition, we find that postspeciational changes in geographic distributions have led to broad sympatry in many species having identical host-plant ranges. Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that the importance of niche shifts for the diversification of herbivorous insects is at present implicitly and explicitly overestimated. In the case of the Higher Nematinae, employing a time correction for sister-species comparisons lowered the proportion of apparent ecology-based speciation events from c. 50-60\% to around 20\%, but such corrections are still lacking in other herbivore groups. The observed convergent but asynchronous shifting among dominant northern plant taxa in many higher-nematine clades, in combination with the broad overlaps in the geographic distributions of numerous nematine species occupying near-identical niches, indicates that host-plant shifts and herbivore community assembly are largely unconstrained by direct or indirect competition among species. More phylogeny-based studies on connections between niche diversification and speciation are needed across many insect taxa, especially in groups that exhibit few host shifts in relation to speciation.},

Data analysed by parsimony and Bayesian inference methods demonstrate that Agaonidae are monophyletic and that the previous classification is not supported. Agaonidae are partitioned into four groups: (i) Tetrapus, (ii) Ceratosolen + Kradibia, (iii) some Blastophaga + Wiebesia species, and (iv) all genera associated with monoecious figs and a few Blastophaga and Wiebesia.

Eleven genera were recovered as monophyletic, six were para- or polyphyletic, and two cannot be tested with our data set. Based on our phylogeny we propose a new classification for the Agaonidae.

Our phylogenetic analysis resolves the relationship among subgenera and tends to agree with morphology-based classification hypotheses. Our molecular clock analysis indicates that the genus Melipona shared a most recent common ancestor at least similar to 14-17 million years (My) ago.

	abstract = {The orchid bees constitute a clade of prominent insect pollinators distributed throughout the Neotropical region. Males of all species collect fragrances from natural sources, including flowers, decaying vegetation and fungi, and store them in specialized leg pockets to later expose during courtship display. In addition, orchid bees provide pollination services to a diverse array of Neotropical angiosperms when foraging for food and nesting materials. However, despite their ecological importance, little is known about the evolutionary history of orchid bees. Here, we present a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis based on similar to 4.0 kb of DNA from four loci [cytochrome oxidase (CO1), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-alpha), arginine kinase (ArgK) and RNA polymerase II (Pol-II)] across the entire tribe Euglossini, including all five genera, eight subgenera and 126 of the approximately 200 known species. We investigated lineage diversification using fossil-calibrated molecular clocks and the evolution of morphological traits using disparity-through-time plots. In addition, we inferred past biogeographical events by implementing model-based likelihood methods. Our dataset supports a new view on generic relationships and indicates that the cleptoparasitic genus Exaerete is sister to the remaining orchid bee genera. Our divergence time estimates indicate that extant orchid bee lineages shared a most recent common ancestor at 27-42 Mya. In addition, our analysis of morphology shows that tongue length and body size experienced rapid disparity bursts that coincide with the origin of diverse genera (Euglossa and Eufriesea). Finally, our analysis of historical biogeography indicates that early diversification episodes shared a history on both sides of Mesoamerica, where orchid bees dispersed across the Caribbean, and through a Panamanian connection, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that recent geological events (e.g. the formation of the isthmus of Panama) contributed to the diversification of the rich Neotropical biota.

We collected molecular data from two nuclear intergenic regions (internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2; 2600 bp in total) to produce the first phylogeny of nocturnal Nearctic mutillids. Bayesian inference of the combined data returned a well-resolved tree with posterior probabilities of over 95\% for most nodes. This tree suggested the monophyly of the nocturnal, primarily Nearctic, Sphaeropthalminae genera, but the paraphyly of the three largest genera (Odontophotopsis. Photomorphus and Sphaeropthalma). Dates of species divergences were obtained using r8s (PL and NPRS) and BEAST with the date of Dominican amber set at three different dates (15 Ma, 20 Ma, and 45 Ma) to account for uncertainty in the fossil age. The derived dates ranged from the Pleistocene to the Middle Miocene, suggesting that both recent Pleistocene glaciation cycles and older orogenic events, albeit to a somewhat greater extent, were both causes of major diversification in western North America. Examination of other phylogeographical studies using North American desert taxa indicated that diversification patterns are explained by either mountain building or Pleistocene climate change, depending on the taxa in question.

Lectotypes are designated for Psaenythia (Parapsaenythia) argentina Friese, Anthrenoides paspali Schrottky and Parapsaenythia paraguayae Brethes. Floral records, distribution maps, illustrations and an identification key are provided. The cladistic analysis of 11 terminal species (all species of Parapsaenythia plus four outgroup species), based on 45 characters of external morphology and male terminalia, produced a single most parsimonious tree. Parapsaenythia was recovered as monophyletic, with the relationships among its species as follows: (P. inornata (P. carinulata sp.n. (P. lanata sp.n. (P. scutellaris sp.n.

	abstract = {Background: Animal mitochondrial genomes are potential models for molecular evolution and markers for phylogenetic and population studies. Previous research has shown interesting features in hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes. Here, we conducted a comparative study of mitochondrial genomes of the family Braconidae, one of the largest families of Hymenoptera, and assessed the utility of mitochondrial genomic data for phylogenetic inference at three different hierarchical levels, i.e., Braconidae, Hymenoptera, and Holometabola. Results: Seven mitochondrial genomes from seven subfamilies of Braconidae were sequenced. Three of the four sequenced A+T-rich regions are shown to be inverted. Furthermore, all species showed reversal of strand asymmetry, suggesting that inversion of the A+T-rich region might be a synapomorphy of the Braconidae. Gene rearrangement events occurred in all braconid species, but gene rearrangement rates were not taxonomically correlated. Most rearranged genes were tRNAs, except those of Cotesia vestalis, in which 13 protein-coding genes and 14 tRNA genes changed positions or/and directions through three kinds of gene rearrangement events. Remote inversion is posited to be the result of two independent recombination events. Evolutionary rates were lower in species of the cyclostome group than those of noncyclostomes. Phylogenetic analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomes and secondary structure of rrnS supported a sister-group relationship between Aphidiinae and cyclostomes. Many well accepted relationships within Hymenoptera, such as paraphyly of Symphyta and Evaniomorpha, a sister-group relationship between Orussoidea and Apocrita, and monophyly of Proctotrupomorpha, Ichneumonoidea and Aculeata were robustly confirmed. New hypotheses, such as a sister-group relationship between Evanioidea and Aculeata, were generated. Among holometabolous insects, Hymenoptera was shown to be the sister to all other orders. Mecoptera was recovered as the sister-group of Diptera. Neuropterida (Neuroptera + Megaloptera), and a sister-group relationship with (Diptera + Mecoptera) were supported across all analyses. Conclusions: Our comparative studies indicate that mitochondrial genomes are a useful phylogenetic tool at the ordinal level within Holometabola, at the superfamily within Hymenoptera and at the subfamily level within Braconidae. Variation at all of these hierarchical levels suggests that the utility of mitochondrial genomes is likely to be a valuable tool for systematics in other groups of arthropods.},

These two closely related endoparasitoids are candidate biological control agents for the white peach scale, Pseudaulacaspis pentagona Targioni-Tozetti (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), in Hawaii. We developed species-specific COI molecular markers that discriminated the two species, and we tested the utility of the E. diaspidicola-specific COI marker to detect parasitism of white peach scale. The COI sequence data uncovered 46-bp differences between the two Encarsia spp. The level of COI genetic divergence between the two species was 9.7\%, and the two clustered into their own clade on a parismonious phylogram. ISSR-PCR readily discriminated the two Encarsia spp. because each was observed with fixed species-specific banding patterns. The COI molecular markers were specific for each species because cross-reactivity was not observed with nontarget species. The E. diaspidicola-specific COI markers were successful at detecting parasitism of white peach scale by E. diaspidicola by 24 h. Both molecular marker types successfully discriminated the two Encarsia spp., whereas the COI markers will be useful as tools to assess levels of parasitism in the field and to study competitive interactions between parasitoids.},

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Mchsp90, Mchsc70 and Mchsp70 were located in cytoplasm. Moreover, the Mchsc70 was a member of heat shock cognate protein 70 while the Mchsp70 was a member of heat shock inducible 70. The expression analysis indicated that these four genes were differentially expressed at larval, pupal and adult stages. Under normal conditions, the mRNA levels of Mchsp90 and Mchsc70 were higher than Mchsp70 while Mchsp23.8 was decreased during aging. The mRNA levels of these four genes could be up-regulated by heat shock besides Mchsp70 and Mchsp23.8 could be increased more dramatically than Mchsp90 and Mchsc70. These results suggested that Mchsp90, Mchsp70 and Mchsp23.8 might have dual functions under normal and heat shock conditions while Mchsp70 and Mchsp23.8 might supply more important protection under heat shock.},

The Ceratinini have a near-global distribution which contrasts strongly with their sister tribe, the Allodapini which has a largely southern Old World distribution. The Ceratinini therefore provides an excellent group to understand the factors that help determine the biogeography and radiation of the bees. This is the first molecular study of ceratinine bees covering representatives from both northern and southern hemisphere Old and New World regions. We use two mitochondrial and one nuclear marker (totalling 2807 nucleotides) to examine the age, cladogenesis and historical biogeography of this tribe. Tree topology and molecular dating support an African origin at about 47 Mya with subsequent dispersal into Eurasia 44 Mya, and followed by an American invasion 32 Mya. Concentrated African and Malagasy sampling revealed there were two or three dispersals events into Madagascar ranging from 25 to 9 Mya. Lineage through time analyses suggest higher rates of cladogenesis close to the origin of the tribe, and this corresponds to both major dispersal events and divergences of lineages leading to extant subgenera. Ceratinini have potentially great importance for future studies to understand the relative roles of dispersal ability and time of origin in determining bee biogeography. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Nestmate recognition in M. postica has been previously demonstrated under experimental conditions. Isolation between individuals during development and nestmate recognition ability in adult females make M. postica an ideal species for testing the occurrence of kin recognition capacity in females. Kin recognition was demonstrated through cross-fostering field experiments involving the single transfer of recently enclosed larvae, and subsequent laboratory recognition bioassays with emerging females. Results suggest kin recognition occurs through self-referent phenotype matching.

	abstract = {Background: Regulation of worker behavior by dominant queens or workers is a hallmark of insect societies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and their evolutionary conservation are not well understood. Honey bee and bumble bee colonies consist of a single reproductive queen and facultatively sterile workers. The queens' influences on the workers are mediated largely via inhibition of juvenile hormone titers, which affect division of labor in honey bees and worker reproduction in bumble bees. Studies in honey bees identified a transcription factor, Kruppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1), whose expression in worker brains is significantly downregulated in the presence of a queen or queen pheromone and higher in forager bees, making this gene an ideal candidate for examining the evolutionary conservation of socially regulated pathways in Hymenoptera. Results: In contrast to honey bees, bumble bees foragers do not have higher Kr-h1 levels relative to nurses: in one of three colonies levels were similar in nurses and foragers, and in two colonies levels were higher in nurses. Similarly to honey bees, brain Kr-h1 levels were significantly downregulated in the presence versus absence of a queen. Furthermore, in small queenless groups, Kr-h1 levels were downregulated in subordinate workers with undeveloped ovaries relative to dominant individuals with active ovaries. Brain Kr-h1 levels were upregulated by juvenile hormone treatment relative to a vehicle control. Finally, phylogenetic analysis indicates that KR-H1 orthologs are presence across insect orders. Though this protein is highly conserved between honey bees and bumble bees, there are significant differences between orthologs of insects from different orders. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Kr-h1 is associated with juvenile hormone mediated regulation of reproduction in bumble bees. The expression of this transcription factor is inhibited by the queen and associated with endocrine mediated regulation of social organization in two species of bees. Thus, KR-H1 may transcriptionally regulate a conserved genetic module that is part of a pathway that has been co-opted to function in social behavior, and adjusts the behavior of workers to their social environmental context.},

	issn = {1471-2148},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-10-109},
	abstract = {Background: The order Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps, sawflies) contains about eight percent of all described species, but no analytical studies have addressed the origins of this richness at family-level or above. To investigate which major subtaxa experienced significant shifts in diversification, we assembled a family-level phylogeny of the Hymenoptera using supertree methods. We used sister-group species-richness comparisons to infer the phylogenetic position of shifts in diversification. Results: The supertrees most supported by the underlying input trees are produced using matrix representation with compatibility (MRC) (from an all-in and a compartmentalised analysis). Whilst relationships at the tips of the tree tend to be well supported, those along the backbone of the tree (e. g. between Parasitica superfamilies) are generally not. Ten significant shifts in diversification (six positive and four negative) are found common to both MRC supertrees. The Apocrita (wasps, ants, bees) experienced a positive shift at their origin accounting for approximately 4,000 species. Within Apocrita other positive shifts include the Vespoidea (vespoid wasps/ants containing 24,000 spp.), Anthophila + Sphecidae (bees/thread-waisted wasps; 22,000 spp.), Bethylidae + Chrysididae (bethylid/cuckoo wasps; 5,200 spp.), Dryinidae (dryinid wasps; 1,100 spp.), and Proctotrupidae (proctotrupid wasps; 310 spp.). Four relatively species-poor families (Stenotritidae, Anaxyelidae, Blasticotomidae, Xyelidae) have undergone negative shifts. There are some two-way shifts in diversification where sister taxa have undergone shifts in opposite directions. Conclusions: Our results suggest that numerous phylogenetically distinctive radiations contribute to the richness of large clades. They also suggest that evolutionary events restricting the subsequent richness of large clades are common. Problematic phylogenetic issues in the Hymenoptera are identified, relating especially to superfamily validity (e. g. “Proctotrupoidea”, “Mymarommatoidea”), and deeper apocritan relationships. Our results should stimulate new functional studies on the causes of the diversification shifts we have identified. Possible drivers highlighted for specific adaptive radiations include key anatomical innovations, the exploitation of rich host groups, and associations with angiosperms. Low richness may have evolved as a result of geographical isolation, specialised ecological niches, and habitat loss or competition.},

Four tRNA genes were rearranged, among which remote inversion is the dominant gene rearrangement event. Gene shuffling is caused by tandem duplication-random loss while remote inversion is best explained by recombination. The start codon of nad1 was found as TTG, which might be common across Hymenoptera. trnS2 and trnK use abnormal anticodons TCT and TTT, respectively, and the D-stem pairings in trnS2 are absent. The secondary structure of two rRNA genes are predicted and compared with those in other insects. Five long intergenic spacers were present, including a long intergenic spacer between atp8 and atp6, where these two genes overlap in the previously reported animal genomes.

	abstract = {We examine phylogenetic relationships within the Synergus complex of herbivorous inquiline gallwasps (Hymenoptera; Cynipidae; Synergini) associated with cynipid host galls on oak, a biologically diverse group whose genus-level morphological taxonomy has long been considered stable but whose species level taxonomy is problematic. We incorporate data for over 70\% of recognised Western Palaearctic species in five morphology-based genera (Ceroptres, Saphonecrus, Synergus, Synophrus, Ufo), comprising sequence for two mitochondrial loci (coxI, cytb) and one nuclear locus (28S D2). In particular, we assess the evidence for monophyly of two long-established, morphology-defined sections within the genus Synergus that differ in a range of biological traits. To aid analyses of ecological interactions within oak cynipid communities, we also consider the utility of cytochrome oxidase I (coxI) DNA barcodes in the oak inquilines. In this assessment, we do not assume that species are delineated at a single threshold value of sequence divergence for a single gene, but examine concordance in the composition of molecular operational Taxonomic units (MOTUs) across a range of sequence divergences in each gene and across genes. We also assess the impact of sampling effort on MOTU stability. Phylogenetic reconstructions for all three loci support monophyly for Synergus and Synophrus, but reject monophyly for Saphonecrus and for the two sections within Synergus. The suites of traits associated with the two sections of the genus Synergus are thus homoplasious. All three loci also reject monophyly for three Synergus species (S. hayneanus, S. pallipes, S. umbraculus). Sequences for each locus identify robust MOTUs that are largely concordant across loci for a range of cut-off values. Though many MOTU's correspond to recognised Linnean species, there is significant, multigene disagreement between groupings supported by morphology and sequence data, with both allocation of different morphospecies to the same MOTU and allocation of the same morphospecies to multiple MOTUs, regardless of cut-off value. Our results imply that while DNA barcoding has considerable utility within this group, morphology-based identification needs major revision at both genus and species levels. Further, life-history traits currently attributed to single morphospecies probably confound attributes of multiple lineages. Revealing patterns of character state evolution in Synergus requires collection of new host association and life history data explicitly linked to DNA barcode data for the specimens concerned.

	abstract = {Meiotic recombination is required for proper chromosome assortment, and accordingly, 1-2 chiasmata per chromosome are found in most species. However, observed recombination rates deviate in some cases from neutral expectations between and within genomes and may play an important role in adaptive evolution. One potentially important argument for an adaptive evolution of recombination rates is the exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rates of social Hymenoptera, in particular the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera. It has the highest metazoan recombination rate reported so far. Proximate or ultimate causes for this elevated recombination rate have not yet been resolved. In a comparative study, we investigated meiotic recombination in the red dwarf honeybee Apis florea. Microsatellite markers developed for A. mellifera were genotyped in a natural mapping population of A. florea. From these genotypes, we calculated local recombination rates, using the physical distances from A. mellifera. In addition to a few comparisons of intervals across the genome, we particularly focused on chromosomes 3 and 12. Confirming marker synteny, we found that recombination rates in A. florea are as high as or higher than those in A. mellifera. Our results are limited to select genomic regions but suggest that A. florea also exhibits an exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate. This trait may thus occur genus wide. Although our study cannot identify a single explanation for the high rates of recombination in Apis, it favors hypotheses that apply to the entire genus. Furthermore, we conclude that the genome structure of the 2 species has been largely conserved, at least in the parts we investigated.},

	abstract = {How to quantify the phylogenetic information content of a data set is a longstanding question in phylogenetics, influencing both the assessment of data quality in completed studies and the planning of future phylogenetic projects. Recently, a method has been developed that profiles the phylogenetic informativeness (PI) of a data set through time by linking its site-specific rates of change to its power to resolve relationships at different timescales. Here, we evaluate the performance of this method in the case of 2 standard genetic markers for phylogenetic reconstruction, 28S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) mitochondrial DNA, with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of relationships within a group of parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae, Diplazontinae). Retrieving PI profiles of the 2 genes from our own and from 3 additional data sets, we find that the method repeatedly overestimates the performance of the more quickly evolving CO1 compared with 28S. We explore possible reasons for this bias, including phylogenetic uncertainty, violation of the molecular clock assumption, model misspecification, and nonstationary nucleotide composition. As none of these provides a sufficient explanation of the observed discrepancy, we use simulated data sets, based on an idealized setting, to show that the optimum evolutionary rate decreases with increasing number of taxa. We suggest that this relationship could explain why the formula derived from the 4-taxon case overrates the performance of higher versus lower rates of evolution in our case and that caution should be taken when the method is applied to data sets including more than 4 taxa.},

For this purpose, a matrix of 36 terminals and 96 characters was coded. The cladistic analysis using character equal weighting resulted in one most parsimonious tree with 189 steps. According to this hypothesis, the subtribe is monophyletic with five synapomorphies supporting it.

	abstract = {External and internal thoracic structures of Nannochorista spp. are described in detail. The results are compared with conditions found in other endopterygote taxa, especially in members of Antliophora. Seventy-seven characters potentially useful for phylogenetic reconstruction are discussed, coded, presented as a data matrix and analysed cladistically. The thorax of Nannochorista shows a number of plesiomorphic characters compared with other mecopterans (except for Merope) and members of the other antliophoran groups (e.g. presence of prospina and associated muscles). No specific affinities of thoracic features of Nannochoristidae and Diptera were found. The cladistic analysis results in strongly supported Antliophora (e.g. intraprofurcal muscle and ventral pleural arms present; bundle of M. mesonoto-pleuralis posterior originates on pleural arm). The thoracic characters do not support the monophyly of Mecoptera. This is possibly an artefact of the analysis. Several potential thoracic autapomorphies of the order are inapplicable in Boreidae, Siphonaptera and Diptera. Boreidae and Siphonaptera share a suite of characters related with flightlessness and are retrieved as sistertaxa when characters associated with wing reduction are predefined as irreversible. Merope appears exceptionally plesiomorphic in its thoracic morphology. Pistillifera (excluding Meropidae) and Panorpoidea (Panorpidae + Panorpodidae) are supported as clades. Due to the strongly modified thoracic morphology of Siphonaptera, the position of this group remains uncertain. The phylogenetic reconstruction using thoracic features alone is clearly impeded by far reaching modifications in Diptera in correlation with an advanced type of anteromotorism, and complex suites of reductional features in the secondary wingless forms.Zusammenfassung Au ss ere und innere Strukturen des Thorax von zwei Nannochorista-Arten wurden untersucht. Die Befunde wurden mit den Verhaltnissen bei anderen Gruppen der Endopterygota, insbesondere Vertretern der Antliophora, verglichen. 77 potentiell phylogenetisch relevante Merkmale wurden diskutiert, kodiert und in einer Datenmatrix zusammengestellt. Zur phylogenetischen Auswertung der Befunde wurden kladistische Analysen durchgefuhrt. Im Vergleich mit anderen Vertretern der Mecoptera (ohne Meropidae) und Antliophora weist der Thorax von Nannochorista zahlreiche plesiomorphe Merkmalszustande auf (z.B. Prospina und mit ihr assoziierte Muskeln vorhanden). Es wurden keine synapomorphen Ubereinstimmungen im Thorax der Nannochoristidae und Diptera gefunden. Die cladistische Analyse ergab eine gut abgesicherte Monophylie der Antliophora (z.B. intraprofurcaler Muskel und ventrale Pleuralarme vorhanden; Anteil des M. mesonoto-pleuralis posterior enstpringt vom Pleuralarm). Die thorakalen Merkmale unterstutzen nicht die Monophylie der Mecoptera. Das ist moglicherweise ein Artefakt, das zumindest teilweise durch die Unanwendbarkeit der moglichen Autapomorphien der Ordnung bei den Boreidae, Siphonaptera und Diptera bedingt ist. Die Boreidae und Siphonaptera weisen ubereinstimmende Apomorphien auf, die mit dem Verlust der Flugfahigkeit zusammenhangen. Sie bilden ein Monophylum, wenn diese Merkmale als irreversibel definiert werden. Merope erscheint besonders ursprunglich bezuglich der thorakalen Morphologie. Die Pistillifera (exkl. Meropidae) werden als Monophylum bestatigt. Die Rekonstruktion der Phylogenie basierend auf thorakalen Merkmalen wird erschwert durch Modifikationen, die sich bei den Diptera aus dem ausgepragten Anteromotorismus ergeben, und bei sekundar flugunfahigen Formen aus vielfaltigen Reduktionserscheinungen.},

	abstract = {Stingless bees (Meliponini) are one of only two highly eusocial bees, the other being the well studied honey bee (Apini). Unlike Apini, with only 11 species in the single genus Apis, stingless bees are a large and diverse taxon comprising some 60 genera, many of which are poorly known. This is the first attempt to infer a phylogeny of the group that includes the world fauna and extensive molecular data. Understanding the evolutionary relationships of these bees would provide a basis for behavioural studies within an evolutionary framework, illuminating the origins of complex social behaviour, such as the employment of dance and sound to communicate the location of food or shelter. In addition to a global phylogeny, we also provide estimates of divergence times and ancestral biogeograhic distributions of the major groups. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses strongly support a principal division of Meliponini into Old and New World groups, with the Afrotropical+Indo-Malay/Australian clades comprising the sister group to the large Neotropical clade. The meliponine crown clade is inferred to be of late Gondwanan origin (approximately 80 Mya), undergoing radiations in the Afrotropical and Indo-Malayan/Australasian regions, approximately 50-60 Mya.

	abstract = {Ecological interactions among organisms may be an essential factor facilitating speciation processes. In one of the most species-rich ant plant symbiotic systems worldwide pioneer trees of the euphorb genus Macaranga are inhabited by specific partner ants, mostly of the genus Crematogaster subgenus Decacrema. Both groups underwent radiation, with 30 species of Macaranga being colonized by eight species of Crematogaster. In this obligate association, the ants rely solely on their host for nutrition and nesting space. Hosts are distributed patchily in disturbed sites or gaps in primary forest. Association patterns are non-random in spite of the often sympatric occurrence of several host-plant species. Generally, each ant species colonizes two to seven different host species over its whole distributional range. Speciation processes in the ants may thus be driven either by adaptation towards alternative host species or by spatial patterns of host distribution, or by both factors. Limited dispersal of queens and nest site limitation due to the obligate association with a host were found to lead to significant isolation by distance on a small spatial scale in primary forest. Extremely high intraspecific genetic variation of mitochondrial markers was in contrast to the low genetic variability of nuclear markers, also pointing towards small population sizes of the ants and the importance of genetic drift in the diversification processes. Adaptation towards alternative hosts may occur as a by-product when different Macaranga hosts are colonized in different regions.},

Of the 469 samples from 14 states subjected to DNA sequencing we found evidence of four mitotypes from the `O' lineage: O5, O5d, O5”b, and O2. Only one of these mitotypes, O2, has been previously observed (in Lebanon). Within the feral population, this lineage accounted for 5\% of the observed mitotypes. Of the 24 `O' lineage samples mitotype O5 was the most common and accounted for 52\% of the total observed `O' mitotypes. Bayesian and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic analysis revealed that O2, O5, and O5d were more closely related to those found in Libya (O5b, O5a, O4a, O4b), Lebanon (O16, O2, O3), and Egypt (O1c). However, O5”b appears to have no close relationship to any of the other mitotypes. The existence of the Middle Eastern `O' lineage in the south central and central United States suggests that further molecular genetic studies of the honey bee population is needed for utilizing and conserving the genetic variation which most likely exists in the Unites States. Furthermore, this study also suggests that feral honey bees are surviving despite the introduction of the varroa mite in the 1980s which reduced the feral and managed populations.},

Totally, 143 specimens (30 male: 113 female) belonging to Ceranisus genus were collected from 20 locations of 38 different localities in Hatay, Gaziantep, Adiyaman and Sanliurfa provinces. The population was divided into 13 groups based on morphologic characters. Phylogenetic relationships amongst Ceranisus species (Chalcidoidea: Eulophidae) were gathered from DNA sequence data. Fifteen species of thrips chalcid parasitoids were analyzed using one gene, D2 domain of the 28S ribosomal DNA. Among morphologically distinct 13 species/taxonomic groups, 3 of them identified as new species according to the genetical analysis. Four of the other species occurred in C. nr. lepidotus group while 5 of C. nr. bozovaensis consisted of two groups. To conclude 3 new species of Ceranisus and 3 different groups that may yield new species were determined in Turkish Ceranisus population.},

	abstract = {Palaeocharis rex n. gen. and sp. (Eucharitidae: Eucharitinae) and Perilampus pisticus n. sp. (Perilampidae: Perilampinae) are described from Baltic amber. Perilampus renzii (Penalver \& Engel) is transferred to Torymidae: Palaeotorymus renzii n. comb. Palaeocharis is related to Psilocharis Heraty based on presence of one anellus, linear mandibular depression, dorsal axillular groove, free prepectus and a transverse row of hairs on the hypopygium. This fossil is unique in comparison with extant Chalcidoidea because there are two foretibial spurs instead of a single well-developed calcar. Perilampus pisticus is placed into the extant Perilampus micans group because the frenum and marginal rim of the scutellum are visible in dorsal view and the prepectus forms a large equilateral triangle. The phylogenetic placement of both genera is discussed based on an analysis of both a combined morphological and molecular (28S and 18S) and morphology-only matrix. Morphological characters were used from an earlier study of Eucharitidae (Heraty 2002), with some characters revised to reflect variation in Perilampinae. Baltic amber is of Eocene age, which puts the age of divergence of these families at more than 40 mya.},

	issn = {1175-5326},
	abstract = {Rhabdepyris (Epyrinae) is a cosmopolitan genus comprised of 132 species. No morphological synapomorphies are known for the genus and the genus is characterized by a combination of characters common to most Epyrini. Herein, we performed a cladistic analysis based on morphological characters to test the monophyly of Rhabdepyris. The three known subgenera of Rhabdepyris (Chlorepyris, Rhabdepyris s. str., and Trichotepyris) and other Epyrini (Anisepyris, Bakeriella, Calyozina, Epyris, Laelius, Trachepyris) were included in the ingroup. The cladistic analysis of 48 taxa (46 ingroup species and two outgroup species) and 81 structural characters yielded 72 cladograms under equal weights, and one under successive weighting. Rhabdepyris was found to be polyphyletic; the subgenus Trichotepyris was closely related to Anisepyris whereas Rhabdepyris str. s. was closely related to Laelius. The subgenus Chlorepyris is paraphyletic. Morphological characters are discussed in the light of the new phylogeny; novel characters are proposed and illustrated, and a new classification of Rhabdepyris and Epyrini is proposed. The following nomenclatural changes are proposed: Trichotepyris is synonymized under Anisepyris (syn. n.); Chlorepyris is recognized as a separated genus (stat. rev.); all 12 American species of the subgenus Rhabdepyris are transferred to Laelius; 22 species of Trichotepyris are transferred to Anisepyris; 58 species are transferred to Chlorepyris. A remaining total of 40 species are now recognized in Rhabdepyris. The holotype of Rhabdepyris, R. myrmecophilus Kieffer, the type species of Rhabdepyris, is redescribed.},

They are known to interfere with the mode of reproduction in some parasitoid wasp and mite hosts, and they are associated with parthenogenesis in the oleander scale, Aspidiotus nerii Bouche (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). Here, we survey A. nerii more broadly for presence of Cardinium species. In total, we tested 593 individuals in 301 populations, representing 132 identified species of armored scale insects, by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of 16S rDNA. We obtained positive PCR results in 67 individuals of 34 populations, representing 20 species and one unidentified individual. Sequencing of these PCR products yields 20 new Cardinium haplotypes, raising the number of known insect-associated Cardinium haplotypes from 15 to 35. The new host-list elucidates the ecology of Cardinium, which in insects seems to be specialized on plant-feeding Hemiptera and associated parasitoid Hymenoptera. A phylogenetic analysis of all known insect-associated Cardinium 16S sequences reveals deep diversity in armored scale insects and implies horizontal transfer of Cardinium among armored scale insects and their parasitoids.},

	abstract = {Wolbachia pipientis can induce a range of sex ratio distortions including parthenogenesis. Recently Wolbachia has been detected in the diploid, parthenogenetic, collembolan species Folsomia candida. In this paper we address the effect of Wolbachia on reproduction in F. candida. Wolbachia infection was removed by antibiotic and heat treatment, and quantitative PCR techniques confirmed the success of the treatments. Complete loss of Wolbachia-infection led to the production of normal clutch sizes, but was associated with full egg hatching failure. Our results demonstrate that F. candida is strictly dependent on Wolbachia to produce viable offspring. This is one of the few cases of obligatory Wolbachia infection in arthropods. Our data suggest a unique mechanism underlying Wolbachia-dependence of egg development. One of our more salient results is that hatching success increased in consecutive egg clutches of antibiotic-treated individuals, probably due to restoration of bacterial densities over time. These observations suggest that reproduction in F. candida is a threshold effect requiring a critical Wolbachia density as is hypothesized by the bacterial dosage model. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that heat or antibiotic treated individuals with egg hatching failure had low average bacterial densities, but bacterial densities were not significantly different from those of treated individuals with successfully eclosing eggs. Additional experiments with partially cured F. candida are needed to prove the dosage model.},
