# OTOL Hymenoptera Bibliography

Snapshots of a curated (in [https://www.zotero.org/download/](Zotero)) bibliography of papers including Hymenopteran phylogenies.  The goal is to use this a basis for upating the [https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/ottol@753726/Hymenoptera]("synthetic" tree for Hymenoptera) and for using in calculating metrics.
