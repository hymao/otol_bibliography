# OTOL Hymenoptera Bibliography

Snapshots of a curated (in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/)) bibliography of papers including Hymenopteran phylogenies.  The goal is to use this a basis for upating the ["synthetic" tree for Hymenoptera](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/ottol@753726/Hymenoptera) and for using in calculating metrics.

# Critera for inclusion in the bibliography

Studies in this bibliography should meet the following criteria:

* The study is _published_.
* The study _has a phylogeny_ inside it.
* The phylogeny is represented by a drawn tree and/or the supplementary material contains or points to a repository (e.g. [DataDryad](http://datadryad.org/) or [Treebase](https://treebase.org/)) that contains a _drawn or digital tree_.
* The focal taxon in at least one of the phylogenies in the study is in (or is) _Hymenoptera_.

# Contributing to the bibliography

There are multiple ways to contribute:

* _Best_: Curate a study on the OTOL site. We will [harvest those studies](#3) from time to time and merge them here.
* _Next best_: Join the  [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/otol_hymenoptera bibliography) group and edit the bibliography directly
* Open an issue here and post a link to the citation, or the citation itself if not available digitally.
* Download the bibliography, merge it with your own bibliography, and send result (currently to Matt).
* Fork the bibliography here on github, merge it, and send a pull request back.
